## **0. Epistemic Status**

This file defines the **Failure Case Canon** for the dissertation.

It is **not** a literature summary.
It is **not** a historical narrative.
It is a **structural comparator**.

The canon exists to answer one question only:

> **What recurring failure patterns emerge when institutional facts are digitized without correct separation of ontology, execution, and governance?**

This file operates at **Substrate-1** and is invalid if it contradicts:

* `ontology.md`
* `dni_theory.md`
* `dni_blueprint.md`
* `sfeu_blueprint.md`
* `corruption_equilibrium.md`
* `counterfactuals.md`

---

## **1. Role of the Failure Case Canon**

The Failure Case Canon is used to:

1. **Validate boundary conditions** of DNI and SFEU
2. **Test CME predictions** against real-world breakdowns
3. **Expose category errors** in “digital governance” systems
4. **Provide adversarial comparators** for empirical chapters

It does **not**:

* rank countries,
* evaluate policy success,
* assign blame,
* propose reforms.

---

## **2. Canon Construction Rule (Hard Constraint)**

A case is admissible **only if**:

1. It involves **administrative institutions** (not markets, not courts, not politics)
2. Digital systems were introduced with claims of:

   * efficiency,
   * transparency,
   * corruption reduction,
   * automation
3. The system failed **structurally**, not merely operationally
4. Failure can be mapped to:

   * ontology violation,
   * execution leakage,
   * governance substitution,
   * or CME contradiction

Cases that fail these criteria are excluded.

---

## **3. Failure Pattern Taxonomy (MECE)**

All admissible failures fall into **five mutually exclusive classes**.

---

## **FP-A: Ontological Collapse**

**Pattern**

* Institutional meaning is implicitly encoded in software
* Status-functions are treated as data fields
* Context C is flattened or ignored

**Observed Outcomes**

* Rule brittleness
* Semantic drift inside execution
* Unresolvable edge cases

**Canonical Examples**

* UK benefits automation failures
* Rule-based eligibility engines without legal context

**Violation Detected**

* Searlean status-function separation
* DNI constitutive rules

---

## **FP-B: Execution–Interpretation Conflation**

**Pattern**

* Execution layer resolves ambiguity
* Protocol “decides” outcomes
* Exceptions are minimized for throughput

**Observed Outcomes**

* Apparent efficiency
* Suppressed disputes
* Invisible discretionary power

**Canonical Examples**

* Algorithmic welfare scoring systems
* “Smart” rule engines with override logic

**Violation Detected**

* SFEU hard prohibitions
* Counterfactual CF-B1 / CF-B2

---

## **FP-C: Corruption Masking (False Cleanliness)**

**Pattern**

* Digitalization reduces visible corruption metrics
* Front-office bribery drops
* No corresponding rise in contestation or exceptions

**Observed Outcomes**

* Clean dashboards
* Low dispute rates
* Centralized control surfaces

**Canonical Examples**

* Aadhaar-linked welfare distribution
* Centralized ID-based entitlement systems

**Violation Detected**

* CME conservation principle
* CF-C2 (Disappearance World)

---

## **FP-D: Discretion Persistence Under Digital Veneer**

**Pattern**

* Digital front-ends exist
* Back-office discretion remains intact
* Manual overrides are common but hidden

**Observed Outcomes**

* Corruption remains front-office
* No migration to attestation or governance layers
* Audit reconstruction fails intermittently

**Canonical Examples**

* Thai administrative IT systems
* Legacy e-government portals

**Violation Detected**

* DNI necessary conditions (N4, N5)
* CF-A1 (Hidden Discretion World)

---

## **FP-E: Governance Substitution Collapse**

**Pattern**

* Digital system replaces human governance
* Exception routing is bypassed
* Contestation channels disappear

**Observed Outcomes**

* Reduced accountability
* Centralized authority
* Institutional brittleness

**Canonical Examples**

* DAO governance failures
* Automated sanctioning systems

**Violation Detected**

* Ontology boundary
* DNI domain eligibility
* CF-D1 boundary test

---

## **4. Thailand as Canonical Stress Case**

Thailand is treated as:

* high discretion,
* high corruption pressure,
* low trust equilibrium.

Thailand is **not** a case study.
It is a **destructive validator**.

Any system that:

* claims DNI,
* claims SFEU execution,
* but fails CME migration in Thailand,

is **invalid globally**.

Thailand anchors:

* FP-D (Discretion persistence)
* FP-C (Corruption masking)

## **5. Canon → CME Mapping**

| Failure Pattern | CME Prediction | Outcome             |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| FP-A            | CME undefined  | Ontology violation  |
| FP-B            | CME suppressed | Category error      |
| FP-C            | CME falsified  | Measurement failure |
| FP-D            | CME absent     | Execution leakage   |
| FP-E            | CME distorted  | Governance collapse |

If a case does **not** map cleanly, the theory is wrong.

---

## **6. Use in Dissertation**

The Failure Case Canon is used to:

* structure Chapter 2 (comparative analysis),
* adversarially test DNI claims,
* validate CME falsifiability,
* constrain generalization.

It is **not** used to argue novelty by enumeration.
Novelty is proven by **survival under comparison**.

---

## **7. Status**

This canon is **frozen** unless:

* DNI theory changes,
* CME is falsified,
* or new failure patterns emerge that do not fit FP-A → FP-E.
