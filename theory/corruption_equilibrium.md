## **0. Epistemic Status and Scope**

This file defines the **Corruption Migration Equilibrium (CME)** as a **formal institutional model**, not a moral claim, cultural theory, or policy aspiration.

CME operates at **Substrate-1 (institutional dynamics)**, strictly grounded in **Substrate-0′ ontology**, and applies **only** under conditions where a **Digital Native Institution (DNI)** is executed via a **Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)**.

CME does **not** claim:

* elimination of corruption  
* moral reform of actors  
* cultural change as a prerequisite  

CME claims **structural relocation of corrupt behavior** when discretionary execution is replaced by protocol-constrained execution.

If DNI conditions are not satisfied, CME is **undefined**.

---

## **1. Ontological Grounding (Substrate-0′)**

Per `ontology.md`, all administrative action is reducible to:

``
X counts as Y in context C
``

Corruption, ontologically, is a **systemic deviation** in which:

* an invalid **X** is made to count as **Y-in-C**, or  
* a valid **X** is prevented from counting as **Y-in-C**,  

through **discretionary, opaque, or unaccountable mechanisms**.

Corruption therefore exists where:

* execution discretion is unbounded,  
* evidence is weak or mutable,  
* state transitions are non-auditable.

---

## **2. Dependency on DNI Conditions**

CME is **defined only** under full DNI conditions as specified in `dni_theory.md`.

Specifically, CME presupposes **all six necessary conditions (N1–N6)**:

* cryptographic identity binding  
* document & evidence integrity  
* programmable settlement  
* protocol-governed state transitions  
* end-to-end auditability  
* explicit exception pathways  

If **any** condition fails, observed corruption patterns are **legacy institutional failures**, not CME.

---

## **3. Role of SFEU (Execution Substrate)**

The **SFEU** is the mechanical substrate that makes CME **observable**.

By enforcing:

* deterministic execution  
* prohibition of discretionary bypass  
* explicit failure signaling  
* immutable attestation and audit reconstruction  

the SFEU:

* collapses front-office discretionary corruption,  
* prevents silent overrides,  
* forces deviation attempts into **bounded, inspectable surfaces**.

The SFEU does **not** reduce intent to corrupt.  
It **reshapes the feasible action space**, altering equilibrium selection.

---

## **4. Actor Strategy Space (MECE)**

Under CME, actors face three mutually exclusive strategies:

### **S1 — On-Protocol Compliance**
* Submit valid **X**
* Allow protocol to execute **X → Y-in-C**
* Low variance, low upside, low risk

### **S2 — On-Protocol Manipulation**
* Manipulate evidence, identity claims, timing, or attestation
* Remains within protocol boundaries
* Detectable via audit
* Liability-bearing

### **S3 — Off-Protocol Bypass**
* Apply pressure outside execution:
* exception abuse
* governance capture
* rule-version manipulation
* coercion of attesters
* Higher coordination cost
* Higher visibility
* Higher contestability

**Key implication:**  
Front-office bribery ceases to be a dominant strategy once DNI + SFEU conditions hold.

---

## **5. Corruption Migration Mechanism**

### **5.1 Pre-DNI Baseline**

Corruption concentrates in:

* discretionary clerks  
* undocumented approvals  
* informal intermediaries  
* mutable records  

Properties:

* low detectability  
* high deniability  
* low coordination cost  

---

### **5.2 Post-DNI Equilibrium (CME)**

Protocol-constrained execution produces **migration**, not elimination:

| Zone | Primary Locus | Structural Properties |
|----|----|----|
| Z1 | Front-office execution | Suppressed by determinism + audit |
| Z2 | Evidence & attestation | Primary attack surface |
| Z3 | Exception governance | Visible, contestable |
| Z4 | Rule evolution / policy | Political, high-cost |

Corruption migrates upward toward zones with:

* higher visibility  
* higher coordination cost  
* higher institutional risk  
* higher contestability  

---

## **6. Formal Equilibrium Claim**

> **CME Claim:**  
> In a DNI executed by an SFEU, corruption pressure reallocates away from discretionary front-office execution toward higher-layer surfaces (attestation, exception governance, rule evolution), because deterministic execution collapses the payoff of low-level deviation while higher-level attacks remain feasible but more visible, costly, and contestable.

This is an **institutional mechanism claim**, not a moral claim.

---

## **7. Observable Predictions**

If CME holds (and DNI conditions are satisfied), deployment yields:

1. Sharp decline in front-office bribery  
2. Temporary rise in attestation disputes and fraud detection  
3. Increase in exception routing volume, then stabilization  
4. Concentration of corruption allegations among:
* attesters
* exception handlers
* rule-governance bodies  
5. Higher coordination cost for corruption attempts  
6. Increased contestability due to execution traces  

---

## **8. Measurement Surfaces (DNM-Compatible)**

CME is measurable via SFEU-native artifacts:

* Protocol conformance rate  
* Exception burden ratio  
* Attestation dispute rate  
* Attester concentration index  
* Governance intervention frequency  
* Off-protocol attempt signatures  

All measures must be derivable from:

* document lineage  
* attestation graphs  
* deterministic execution traces  

---

## **9. Falsification Conditions**

CME is falsified if, **under satisfied DNI conditions**, any of the following persist:

* **F1:** Corruption remains primarily front-office and opaque  
* **F2:** Discretionary off-protocol execution remains dominant  
* **F3:** Attestation and exception surfaces are not measurable  
* **F4:** Low-cost deniable corruption pathways persist  

Observed falsifiers imply either:

* CME is wrong, or  
* claimed DNI/SFEU conditions were not actually enforced.

---

## **10. Relationship to Failure Canon**

CME explains why digitization fails when execution remains discretionary:

* Identity systems without bounded execution relocate harm  
* Protocols without exception governance collapse under edge cases  
* Legacy IT modernization preserves corruption channels  

CME is the **mechanism bridge** between:

* DNI theory  
* SFEU execution  
* comparative institutional failure analysis  

---

## **11. Boundary Conditions**

CME applies **only** to administrative state transitions that satisfy DNI eligibility.

It does **not** apply to:

* adjudication  
* moral or political judgment  
* domains where meaning cannot be protocol-bounded  

Extending CME beyond these domains is a category error.

---

## **12. Status**

This model is **frozen** unless contradicted by:

* Substrate-0′ violations  
* DNI theory revision  
* empirical counterexample under fully enforced SFEU execution
