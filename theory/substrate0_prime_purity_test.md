# **SUBSTRATE-0′ PURITY TEST (v1.1)**

*A canonical constraint system for all DNI / SFEU / Civita outputs.*

A proposal, concept, architectural change, dissertation paragraph, methodological decision, or evaluative framework is **valid iff it passes all tests below**.

Failure of **any single test** → **INVALID — redesign required**.

This test suite has **epistemic priority** over:
- EVP
- award frameworks
- dissertation presentation
- narrative positioning

---

## **TEST 1 — Status-Function Integrity**

Does the idea preserve the mapping:

``
X counts as Y in context C
``


without:
- conflating X, Y, or C,
- embedding interpretation into X or Y,
- expanding C implicitly or post-hoc?

If the status-function structure is altered, blurred, or inferred → **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `ontology.md`

---

## **TEST 2 — Protocol Boundary Correctness**

Does the idea strictly maintain the boundary:

> **Protocols execute institutional facts; they do not interpret meaning.**

If the idea introduces into **SFEU execution**:
- semantic interpretation,
- moral reasoning,
- adjudication,
- political judgment,
- AI discretion,

→ **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `sfeu_blueprint.md`

---

## **TEST 3 — Representational Sufficiency (SFEU Primitives)**

Can the idea be fully represented using **only**:

- identity binding (minimum viable legal/person identity),
- document & evidence lineage,
- attestation graphs,
- deterministic state-transition logic,
- explicit exception signaling?

If it requires:
- total identity,
- implicit context,
- AI judgment,
- probabilistic inference,
- hidden human discretion,

→ **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `sfeu_prototype.md`

---

## **TEST 4 — Falsifiability & Counterfactual Rigor**

Does the idea produce:

- a falsifiable claim,
- discriminable predictions,
- observable indicators,
- counterfactual signatures that differ between
- DNI-compliant execution and
- non-DNI systems?

If not empirically distinguishable → **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `dni_theory.md`, `counterfactuals.md`

---

## **TEST 5 — CME Consistency**

Does the idea respect **Corruption Migration Equilibrium**:

``
L1 → L2 → L3
``


under execution constraints?

If it:
- claims corruption “elimination,”
- hides discretion,
- collapses layers,
- bypasses attestation or exception pressure,

→ **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `corruption_equilibrium.md`

---

## **TEST 6 — DNI Domain Eligibility**

Does the idea operate **only** in domains where all hold:

1. Rules are executable without interpretation  
2. Evidence is verifiable and lineage-bound  
3. Identity sufficiency is minimal (not total)  
4. Exceptions are bounded and explicit  
5. Institutional facts remain pure (non-normative)

If it drifts into:
- adjudication,
- moral rights,
- political authority,
- contextual meaning resolution,

→ **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `dni_blueprint.md`

---

## **TEST 7 — Drift & Failure-Canon Alignment**

Does the idea avoid **all canonical failure patterns**, including:

- digitization without execution,
- identity overreach,
- exception suppression,
- protocol absolutism,
- discretionary backdoors,
- centralized override,
- DAO-style governance collapse?

If it reproduces any known failure mode → **FAIL**.

**Anchor:** `failure_case_canon.md`

---

## **TEST 8 — Evaluator & Framework Purity**

Any evaluative framework (EVP, award ruler, rubric, ranking, narrative lens):

MUST:
1. Be explicitly mapped to Substrate-0′ ontology  
2. Introduce **no external ontology** unfiltered  
3. Never override status-functions, SFEU primitives, or CME  
4. Influence **presentation only**, never theory or execution

If an evaluative layer shapes ontology, theory, or architecture → **FAIL**.

---

## **Verdict Rule**

An idea is **Substrate-0′ Pure** iff:

``
T1 ∧ T2 ∧ T3 ∧ T4 ∧ T5 ∧ T6 ∧ T7 ∧ T8 = TRUE
``


Else:

> **INVALID — redesign required.**

---

## **Status**

**Frozen.**

This file may only change if:
- the status-function ontology changes, or
- a higher-substrate contradiction is proven.
