### *Canonical Meta-Class Definition*

**Version 1.0 — Meta-Institutional · Non-Ontological · Non-Executing · Authoritative**

---

## **Epistemic Status (Hard Constraint)**

This file defines **Computable Institutions (CI)** as a **meta-class of institutions**.

It is:

* **Above** ontology, theory, execution, and methodology
* **Not ontological** (does not define status-function primitives)
* **Not theoretical** (does not replace DNI theory)
* **Not architectural** (does not define SFEU)
* **Not methodological** (does not define DNM)
* **Not evaluative** (does not argue desirability or policy)

This file exists solely to **fix the abstraction hierarchy** of the project.

If this file is deleted:

* `ontology.md` remains valid
* `dni_theory.md` remains valid
* `sfeu_blueprint.md` remains valid
* All execution artifacts remain valid

If this file is contradicted:

* the project becomes **conceptually incoherent**

## **1. Definition — Computable Institutions (CI)**

> **Computable Institutions (CI)** are institutions whose
> **status-functions, execution constraints, evidentiary conditions,
> and failure modes** are specified in **formally expressible, mechanically executable,
> auditable, and falsifiable forms**, such that institutional facts are:
>
> * deterministically produced or explicitly rejected,
> * resistant to silent discretionary execution, and
> * observable under adversarial conditions.

CI names a **civilizational class of institutions**, not a technology, platform, or implementation.

---

## **2. What CI Is — and Is Not**

### **CI IS**

* a **meta-class over institutional systems**
* a criterion for **institutional computability**
* an envelope within which:

  * execution can be audited,
  * corruption relocates instead of disappearing,
  * failure surfaces explicitly

### **CI IS NOT**

* a technology stack
* an implementation class
* a protocol
* an execution engine
* a replacement for law or governance
* a synonym for digitization or automation

CI does **not** imply:

* blockchain governance
* AI decision-making
* elimination of human judgment
* elimination of corruption

## **3. Canonical Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable)**

This project uses the following **fixed abstraction hierarchy**:

```
Layer 1 — Meta-Class
Computable Institutions (CI)

Layer 2 — Institutional Type (Theory)
Digital Native Institutions (DNI)

Layer 3 — Execution Substrate (Mechanism)
Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)
```

Formal relationships:

* **CI ⊃ DNI**
* **DNI requires SFEU-class execution**
* **SFEU is not an institution**
* **CI is not an implementation**

Any artifact violating these relationships is **invalid**.

---

## **4. Relationship to Existing Project Artifacts**

### **Ontology**

* `ontology.md` defines **what institutional facts are**
* CI does **not** add or modify ontological primitives

### **DNI Theory**

* `dni_theory.md` defines **a subclass of CI**
* DNI is the **first fully realizable institutional type** within CI

### **Execution (SFEU)**

* `sfeu_blueprint.md` defines execution machinery
* SFEU **enforces** DNI (and future CI-eligible institutions)
* SFEU does not define CI or DNI

### **Methodology**

* `dnm_methodology.md` is **CI-compatible**
* DNM governs **evidence inside CI systems**
* CI itself is not a methodology

### **Models & Validation**

* CME, counterfactuals, and failure canon
  operate **within CI-eligible institutions**
* CI defines the **outer falsification envelope**

---

## **5. Boundary Conditions**

An institution is **not** a Computable Institution if:

* execution is discretionary and opaque
* failure is silently absorbed
* institutional facts require interpretive narration to reconstruct
* corruption disappears instead of relocating observably
* execution substitutes for governance

CI is therefore **structurally adversarial**:
it assumes hostile environments and worst-case conditions.

---

## **6. Role in the Dissertation**

Within the dissertation:

* **CI** is the **umbrella class**
* **DNI** is the **theoretical focus**
* **SFEU** is the **execution mechanism**
* Empirical work tests **whether DNI satisfies CI criteria**

CI is introduced **after** ontology and before methodology,
as a **classification frame**, not a proposal.

---

## **7. Status**

**Frozen (v1.0).**

This file may change only if:

* the abstraction hierarchy is revised, or
* a new institutional meta-class supersedes CI.
