## Epistemic Status (Hard Lock)

EVP v3.0 is a **presentation-layer protocol** governing how
**already-validated work** may be *described*, *positioned*, and *communicated*
to external evaluators (academics, funders, institutions).

EVP v3.0 is:

- **non-authoritative**
- **non-validating**
- **non-falsifying**
- **non-architectural**
- **non-ontological**

EVP v3.0 does **not**:
- define truth
- define rigor
- define correctness
- define success
- define institutional validity

If EVP is removed, **no truth, theory, architecture, or evidence changes**.

If deletion changes meaning → this file is invalid.

---

## Dependency Order (Explicit, One-Way)

EVP v3.0 is strictly downstream of:

1. `substrate0_prime_purity_test.md`
2. `ontology.md`
3. `dni_theory.md`
4. `dni_blueprint.md`
5. `sfeu_blueprint.md`
6. `sfeu_prototype.md`
7. `corruption_equilibrium.md`
8. `counterfactuals.md`
9. `failure_case_canon.md`
10. `dnm_methodology.md`
11. `meta_ruler.md`
12. Award extraction / pattern / ruler files

Influence is **one-directional only**:

``
Substrate-0′ / Theory / Execution
↓
EVP (Description Only)
``


Any reverse influence → **FAIL (Purity Test 8)**.

---

## Purpose

EVP v3.0 answers one question only:

> **How can this work be *described* to external evaluators  
> without distorting its truth conditions?**

EVP manages **visibility**, not **validity**.

## What Changed from EVP v2.0 (Explicit)

Relative to EVP v2.0 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, EVP v3.0 introduces **hard role correction**:

### Removed
- implicit claims of “backbone” or “field-defining” authority
- language implying evaluator standards shape rigor
- any suggestion that EVP corrects ontology, theory, or execution

### Retained (but demoted)
- synthesis of critiques (as narrative context)
- mapping of how others *talk about* rigor, incentives, governance
- visibility strategy for examiners and institutions

### Added
- **deletability test**
- **explicit subordination**
- **directionality enforcement**
- **meta-ruler compliance**

---

## EVP Core Rules (MECE)

### **EVP-1 — Description, Not Validation**
EVP may describe how evaluators might *perceive*:
- rigor
- novelty
- relevance
- integration

EVP must never claim:
- correctness
- necessity
- sufficiency
- inevitability

---

### **EVP-2 — No Theory Shaping**
EVP must not:
- motivate theory design
- select architectures
- justify execution choices
- influence falsification thresholds

Theory stands or falls **without EVP**.

---

### **EVP-3 — No Execution Shielding**
EVP must not:
- excuse empirical weakness
- mask CME failures
- substitute for pilots
- soften counterfactual falsifiers

If execution fails, EVP is irrelevant.

---

### **EVP-4 — Evaluator Language Is Descriptive Only**
All references to:
- MIT / Oxford / Harvard
- awards
- elite evaluators
- institutional prestige

are treated as **descriptive vocabularies**, not standards of truth.

---

### **EVP-5 — Deletability Invariant**
For any section of EVP:

> If removed,  
> no ontological claim, theoretical claim, architectural decision,  
> or empirical result changes.

If this condition fails → section invalid.

---

## Relationship to Critiques (Reframed)

Critiques from AI systems, academics, or reviewers are treated as:

- **descriptions of perceived weaknesses**
- **inputs to narrative clarification**
- **signals of miscommunication risk**

They are **not**:
- truth arbiters
- theory generators
- architectural constraints

Corrections only matter **if independently validated** by:
- SFEU execution
- CME observability
- counterfactual discrimination

---

## Relationship to Methodology

EVP does not define method.

DNM (`dnm_methodology.md`) defines:
- how evidence is generated
- how claims are falsified

EVP may only **reference** methodology to explain
*how rigor is demonstrated*, never to define it.

---

## Relationship to Award Frameworks

EVP may draw from:

- `award_extraction_outline_v2.2.md`
- `award_pattern_extraction_framework.md`
- `award_ruler_construction_guide.md`

Only to:
- anticipate evaluator phrasing
- order exposition
- clarify emphasis

Award logic must pass **Meta-Ruler constraints**.
Failure → discard award framing, not theory.

---

## Permitted Uses

EVP v3.0 may be used to:

- structure dissertation defense narratives
- prepare examiner-facing explanations
- align terminology with evaluator expectations
- reduce misinterpretation risk

---

## Prohibited Uses

EVP v3.0 must never be used to:

- claim superiority
- justify funding
- override falsification
- argue inevitability
- replace empirical work
- influence architecture

Any such use → **INVALID**.

---

## Status

**Frozen — EVP v3.0**

This file may change only if:
- Substrate-0′ ontology changes, or
- the project abandons presentation-layer separation entirely.
