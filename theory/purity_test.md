# **SUBSTRATE-0′ PURITY TEST (v1.0)**

*A canonical 8-test constraint for all NSU/DNI/Civita outputs.*

A proposal, concept, architectural change, dissertation paragraph, or methodological decision is valid only if it passes **all seven tests** below. Failure of any test → **rejection or redesign**.

---

## **TEST 1 — Status-Function Integrity**

**Does the idea preserve the mapping**
`X counts as Y in context C`
without conflating X, Y, or C?
If it alters, expands, obscures, or misplaces the status-function structure → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to ontology.md)

---

## **TEST 2 — Protocol Boundary Correctness**

Does the idea **maintain** the boundary:
**protocol executes institutional facts; protocol does not interpret them**?
If it introduces interpretation, moral reasoning, adjudication, or political judgment into NSU → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to nsu_blueprint.md)

---

## **TEST 3 — Representational Sufficiency (NSU Primitives)**

Can the idea be represented using only:

* MVLP identity
* Document lineage
* Attestation graph
* Deterministic state-transition logic

If it requires total identity, AI judgment, ambiguous evidence, unbounded context, or implicit inference → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to nsu_prototype.md)

---

## **TEST 4 — Falsifiability & Counterfactual Rigor**

Does the idea produce:

* a falsifiable claim
* discriminable predictions
* measurable observables
* counterfactual signatures

If not → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to dni_theory.md + counterfactuals.md)

---

## **TEST 5 — CME Consistency**

Does the idea respect the equilibrium structure:
`L1 → L2 → L3 corruption migration`
under protocol constraints?

If it denies migration, introduces hidden discretion, modifies attester roles improperly, or collapses governance layers → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to corruption_equilibrium.md)

---

## **TEST 6 — DNI Domain Eligibility**

Does the idea operate in domains satisfying:

1. Rule executability
2. Evidence verifiability
3. MVLP identity sufficiency
4. Bounded exceptions
5. Institutional-fact purity

If it drifts into adjudication, morality, political rights, or contextual meaning → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to dni_blueprint.md)

---

## **TEST 7 — Drift & Stability (Failure Canon Alignment)**

Does the idea avoid the canonical failure patterns from Estonia, Aadhaar, DAO collapses, UK IT failures, Singapore limits, and Thailand friction?

If it introduces identity overreach, exception denial, protocol absolutism, legacy digitization, unbounded attestation, or centralized discretion → **FAIL**.

(Anchored to failure_case_canon.md)

---

**TEST 8 — Evaluator & Framework Purity**
Any evaluative framework (award ruler, rubric, scoring system, narrative lens) used to judge DNI/NSU/Civita must:

1. Be explicitly mapped to Substrate-0′ ontology.
2. Not introduce external ontologies (market, behavioral, governance, CS metaphysics) without reinterpretation.
3. Not override or reshape status-functions, NSU primitives, or CME.
4. Not determine theory design, only presentation and positioning.
   If any evaluative framework violates these conditions → **FAIL**.

---

# **Verdict Rule**

A proposal is **Substrate-0′ Pure** **iff**:

```
Test1 = PASS
∧ Test2 = PASS
∧ Test3 = PASS
∧ Test4 = PASS
∧ Test5 = PASS
∧ Test6 = PASS
∧ Test7 = PASS
∧ Test8 = PASS
```

Else → **INVALID — must be redesigned or rejected.**

---

# **Frozen.**

No modifications unless contradictions arise in higher substrate reasoning.
