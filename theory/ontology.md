# **Status-Function Ontology for Digital Institutions**

### *Version 1.0 (Frozen Foundation)*

---

## **0. Purpose**

This file establishes the **foundational ontology** for NSU and DNI using **Searle’s Status-Function theory**.
It replaces the earlier Four-Plane model and eliminates all category errors flagged by AI reviewers.

This ontology is the **base layer** of the dissertation, the architecture, and the NSU protocol.

# **1. Ontological Core: Searle’s Status Functions**

Institutions exist because humans use **collective intentionality** to assign **status functions**:

```
X counts as Y in context C
```

Where:

* **X** = brute fact (physical or digital artifact)
* **Y** = institutional fact (the meaning assigned to X)
* **C** = context (the system of rules enabling the assignment)

### Example:

```
Digital signature (X) counts as legal consent (Y) in Thai commercial law (C)
```
**External Framework Constraint**
All external theories, awards, and evaluative frameworks must be treated as **subordinate descriptive overlays** on top of the core ontology.

* They may help interpret or communicate the ontology.
* They may not redefine what counts as:

  * brute fact
  * institutional fact
  * status-function
  * context
    Any conflict → ontology.md wins. 

This is the **universal structure** for every institutional act in governance.

Protocols **do not replace** institutions—they **enforce the mapping** between X and Y.

---

# **2. Institutions as Status-Function Systems**

Institutions operate through *status declarations*, backed by:

* **Rules of recognition** (what counts)
* **Rules of application** (how counting is performed)
* **Rules of enforcement** (how violations are handled)

Every administrative action is fundamentally:

* A **mapping** (from brute fact to institutional fact)
* A **transition** (change in institutional state)
* A **recording** (attestation and audit)

This is the correct ontology for all governance processes.

---

# **3. Role of Protocols in the Ontology**

Protocols do **not** create institutions.
Protocols **instantiate and enforce** the status-function rules.

They formalize:

1. **What X must be** (digital signature format, identity binding)
2. **How X is validated**
3. **How Y is applied** (state-transition logic)
4. **How context C is encoded** (legal conditions)
5. **How exceptions are surfaced** (non-binary cases)

Thus:

```
Protocols = execution machinery for status-function rules.
```

They **do not** define Y.
They **do not** define C.
They **only guarantee that when X claims to be Y-in-C, the claim is verifiable.**

---

# **4. NSU Ontology (Formal Definition)**

The **National Service Unit (NSU)** is:

> A **status-function execution engine** for administrative institutions, where protocol-defined rules ensure that X→Y transitions are applied consistently, transparently, and with verifiable attestation.

NSU:

* Does **not** legislate
* Does **not** interpret law
* Does **not** adjudicate

NSU:

* **Executes** administrative state transitions
* Ensures **attestations are valid**
* Ensures **records are immutable**
* Ensures **workflow cannot deviate off-protocol**

NSU is the **institutional machinery**, not the institution itself.

---

# **5. DNI Ontology (Formal Definition)**

A **Digital Native Institution (DNI)** is:

> An institution where the status-function mappings (X→Y-in-C) are executed through **protocol-constrained mechanisms**, such that administrative discretion is minimized, auditability is maximized, and identity/document/money primitives are natively digital.

A DNI is **not** “digital government.”
A DNI is **an institutional form** defined by:

* Native digital identity binding
* Native digital document integrity
* Native programmable settlement
* Protocol-governed state transitions

A DNI is the **institutional type**;
NSU is the **infrastructure** enabling it.

# **6. Why This Ontology Fixes All Prior Category Errors**

### Fix 1: Institutions vs. Protocols

We now correctly distinguish:

* **Institutional facts (Y)** → social
* **Protocol execution (X→Y enforcement)** → technical

The Four-Plane confusion disappears.

### Fix 2: Representation Limits

Protocol cannot encode **Y** or **C** fully.
That is correct.
Only encode what is necessary to apply **the declarative rule**.

### Fix 3: Semantic Drift

Semantic evolution happens in **context C**, not the protocol.
Protocol only enforces validity of X.

### Fix 4: Exceptions

Exception = X cannot reliably count as Y-in-C.
The ontology makes this explicit and unavoidable, not a bug.

# **7. Application to NSU/DNI Dissertation**

This ontology becomes the basis for:

* Chapter 1 (the conceptual frame)
* Chapter 2 (institutional literature review)
* Chapter 3 (methodology)
* NSU architecture
* DNI theory
* Corruption equilibrium model
* MVP design
* All future chapters

This file is the **bedrock**.

---

# **8. Frozen**

This file is **frozen** for dissertation stability.
Revisions only upon encountering structural contradictions.
