## **Ontological Status and Epistemic Role**

This ontology is **constitutive**, not descriptive.

It does not attempt to explain, summarize, or interpret existing institutions.
It **defines the necessary and sufficient conditions** under which an institutional fact
*exists*, *binds*, and *executes* in a digital-native environment.

Accordingly:

1. All primitives defined herein operate at **Substrate-0′**.
2. These definitions are **world-binding**:
   if a system does not satisfy them, it is *not* a Digital Native Institution (DNI),
   regardless of surface similarity or institutional naming.
3. Ontological validity is **not contingent** on:
   - academic consensus
   - historical precedent
   - legal recognition
   - policy adoption
   - evaluator interpretation
4. Downstream artifacts (theory, blueprints, prototypes, simulations, and chapters)
   must **conform to this ontology**, not revise it.

This ontology therefore functions as an **execution constraint**, not an analytical lens.
All higher-layer reasoning (Substrate-1 and Substrate-2) is invalid if it violates
any definition specified here.

## **0. Purpose**

This file establishes the **foundational ontology** for **SFEU and DNI**
using **Searle’s Status-Function theory**.

It replaces earlier multi-plane models and eliminates all category errors
between institutions, protocols, and execution machinery.

This ontology is the **base layer** of the dissertation,
the architecture, and all execution blueprints.

# **1. Ontological Core: Searle’s Status Functions**

Institutions exist because humans use **collective intentionality**
to assign **status functions**:

``
X counts as Y in context C
``


Where:

- **X** = brute fact (physical or digital artifact)
- **Y** = institutional fact (the meaning assigned to X)
- **C** = context (the system of rules enabling the assignment)

### Example

``
Digital signature (X) counts as legal consent (Y) in Thai commercial law (C)
``

## **External Framework Constraint**

All external theories, awards, and evaluative frameworks are
**subordinate descriptive overlays** on top of this ontology.

They may:
- help interpret or communicate the ontology

They may **not** redefine:
- brute facts
- institutional facts
- status functions
- contexts

Any conflict → **ontology.md prevails**.

Protocols **do not replace institutions** —
they **enforce the mapping** between X and Y.

---

# **2. Institutions as Status-Function Systems**

Institutions operate through **status declarations**, backed by:

- rules of recognition (what counts)
- rules of application (how counting is performed)
- rules of enforcement (how violations are handled)

Every administrative action is:

- a **mapping** (X → Y)
- a **transition** (institutional state change)
- a **recording** (attestation and audit)

This is the correct ontology for governance.

---

# **3. Role of Protocols in the Ontology**

Protocols do **not** create institutions.
They **instantiate and enforce** status-function rules.

They formalize:

1. what X must be
2. how X is validated
3. how Y is applied (state transition)
4. how context C is bound
5. how exceptions are surfaced

Thus:

``
Protocols = execution machinery for status-function rules
``


Protocols do **not** define Y.
Protocols do **not** define C.
They only guarantee that **claims are verifiable**.

---

# **4. SFEU Ontology (Formal Definition)**

A **Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)** is:

> A **status-function execution engine** for administrative institutions,
> where protocol-defined rules ensure that X → Y transitions
> are applied deterministically, transparently,
> and with verifiable attestation.

An SFEU:

- does **not** legislate
- does **not** interpret law
- does **not** adjudicate disputes

An SFEU:

- executes administrative state transitions
- validates attestations
- produces immutable records
- prevents off-protocol execution

An SFEU is **institutional machinery**, not an institution.

---

# **5. DNI Ontology (Formal Definition)**

A **Digital Native Institution (DNI)** is:

> An institution whose status-function mappings (X → Y in C)
> are executed through **protocol-constrained mechanisms**,
> such that administrative discretion is minimized,
> auditability is maximized,
> and institutional primitives are natively digital.

A DNI is **not** digital government.

A DNI is defined by:

- native digital identity binding
- native document integrity
- native programmable settlement
- protocol-governed state transitions

A DNI is the **institutional form**.
An SFEU is the **execution infrastructure** enabling it.

---

# **6. Why This Ontology Fixes Prior Category Errors**

**Institutions vs Protocols**
- Institutional facts (Y): social
- Execution (X → Y): technical

**Representation limits**
- Protocols encode execution, not meaning.

**Semantic drift**
- Drift occurs in context C, not in execution machinery.

**Exceptions**
- Failure of X to count as Y is explicit, not hidden.

---

# **7. Application to the SFEU/DNI Dissertation**

This ontology underpins:

- Chapter 1 (conceptual frame)
- Chapter 2 (literature)
- Chapter 3 (methodology)
- SFEU architecture
- DNI theory
- Corruption Equilibrium Model
- Prototypes and simulations

This file is the **bedrock**.

---

# **8. Frozen**

This ontology is **frozen**.
Revisions only upon structural contradiction.
