## *Meta-Ruler for Evaluative Frameworks*
## *Substrate-0′ Constrained · Presentation-Layer Only · Non-Authoritative*

## Epistemic Status (Hard Constraint)

This file defines a **Meta-Ruler**:  
a *governing constraint* on how **any evaluative, award, ranking, or narrative ruler**
may be constructed or used within this project.

It is **explicitly non-authoritative**.

This file:

- does **not** define ontology  
- does **not** define DNI theory  
- does **not** define SFEU architecture or execution  
- does **not** validate correctness  
- does **not** participate in falsification  

Its sole function is to **prevent evaluative frameworks from contaminating
Substrate-0′, Substrate-1, or execution layers**.

If this file conflicts with any upstream artifact, **this file is invalid**.

---

## Dependency Order (Non-Negotiable)

This Meta-Ruler is strictly subordinate to:

1. `substrate0_prime_purity_test.md`
2. `ontology.md`
3. `dni_theory.md`
4. `dni_blueprint.md`
5. `sfeu_blueprint.md`
6. `sfeu_prototype.md`
7. `corruption_equilibrium.md`
8. `counterfactuals.md`
9. `failure_case_canon.md`

It may *govern* downstream evaluative artifacts only.

---

## Purpose

The Meta-Ruler answers one question:

> **Under what conditions may an evaluative or award-based framework exist  
> without distorting institutional truth?**

It exists to enforce the rule:

> **Evaluation may describe perception.  
> Only execution and falsification determine truth.**

---

## Scope of Authority (Strictly Limited)

The Meta-Ruler governs **only**:

- award rulers
- narrative alignment frameworks
- evaluator-facing rubrics
- presentation-layer comparative lenses
- diffusion or recognition framing

It has **zero authority** over:

- ontology
- institutional theory
- architectural requirements
- execution machinery
- empirical claims
- falsification thresholds

---

## Core Constraint Rules (MECE)

### **MR-1 — Ontology Firewall**

No evaluative framework may:

- redefine X, Y, or C
- introduce new institutional entities
- imply ontological necessity
- claim institutional legitimacy

Ontology is fixed by `ontology.md`.

Violation → **FAIL**.

---

### **MR-2 — Theory Non-Interference**

No evaluative framework may:

- alter DNI necessary or sufficient conditions
- weaken falsification criteria
- introduce alternative validity standards

DNI truth is settled only by:
- falsification
- counterfactuals
- execution evidence

Violation → **FAIL**.

---

### **MR-3 — Execution Non-Interference**

No evaluative framework may:

- imply execution correctness
- validate SFEU behavior
- substitute for audit or reconstruction
- mask execution failure

Execution is validated only by:
- SFEU invariants
- CME observability
- counterfactual discrimination

Violation → **FAIL**.

---

### **MR-4 — Directionality Constraint**

All influence must flow **one-way**:

``
Substrate-0′ / Theory / Execution
↓
Evaluative Description Only
``


Any reverse influence → **FAIL**.

---

### **MR-5 — Deletability Test**

An evaluative artifact governed by this Meta-Ruler must satisfy:

> **If deleted, no theoretical, architectural, or empirical meaning changes.**

If deletion alters meaning → the artifact is invalid.

---

## Permitted Uses

Under this Meta-Ruler, evaluative frameworks may be used **only** to:

- assist narrative framing
- anticipate evaluator language
- sequence presentation emphasis
- translate work into external descriptive vocabularies

They may **not** be used to:

- argue correctness
- imply inevitability
- assert superiority
- override falsification
- justify architecture

---

## Relationship to Award Frameworks

- `award_extraction_outline_v2.2.md`  
→ supplies **descriptive pattern boundaries**

- `award_pattern_extraction_framework.md`  
→ supplies **raw descriptive categories**

- `award_ruler_construction_guide.md`  
→ supplies **procedural construction rules**

All such artifacts are governed by this Meta-Ruler.

---

## Relationship to EVP v2.0

EVP v2.0 may reference evaluator narratives **only** if:

- explicitly marked as presentation-layer
- subordinate to falsification
- non-authoritative
- deletable without impact

If EVP violates these constraints, **EVP is wrong**, not the theory.

---

## Validation Rule

A Meta-Ruler–governed evaluative artifact is valid **iff**:

- it passes **Substrate-0′ Purity Test (Test 8)**,
- it introduces zero upstream influence,
- it operates only at presentation layer,
- it fails no MR-1 through MR-5.

Else:

> **INVALID — redesign or deletion required.**

---

## Status

**Frozen.**

This file may change only if:
- the Substrate-0′ Purity Test changes, or
- evaluative framing is abandoned entirely.
