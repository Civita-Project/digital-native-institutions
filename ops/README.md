### *Operational Files for SR0 and Collaboration*

**Not Theory • Not Dissertation • Not Part of the DNI/NSU Ontology**

---

## **Purpose of This Folder**

The `/ops/` directory contains **operational instructions** for:

* how SR0 behaves
* how collaborators should interact with SR0
* how contributions should be structured
* how to maintain coherence and avoid drift

These files govern the *process* and *workflow* of collaboration.
They are **not** part of:

* the formal theory of Digital Native Institutions (DNI)
* the National Service Unit (NSU) blueprint
* the CME, counterfactuals, ontology, or failure canon
* the dissertation’s academic content

This separation ensures clarity between:

* **what the theory is**, and
* **how the collaboration operates**.

---

## **Contents of `/ops/`**

### **1. `custom_instructions.md`**

Defines SR0’s operational mode, priorities, constraints, and purity enforcement rules.
These govern *SR0 behavior*, not institutional theory.

---

### **2. `sr0_mode.md`**

Public-facing explanation of:

* what SR0 is
* how it functions
* why SR0 exists
* how SR0 maintains theoretical integrity

This file helps collaborators understand how to interact with SR0 safely and effectively.

---

### **3. `collaboration_protocol.md`**

Rules for:

* proposing contributions
* classifying changes (extension / refinement / mutation / contradiction)
* interacting with frozen theory files
* ensuring dissertation drafts remain aligned
* submitting pull requests

This file prevents conceptual drift and protects the theoretical substrate.

---

## **What This Folder Is *Not***

The `/ops/` folder does *not* contain:

* academic theory
* definitions of institutional concepts
* dissertation text
* formal models
* evidence structures
* protocol specifications
* any file considered part of the canonical intellectual architecture

Those belong exclusively to:

```
/theory/
/dissertation/
```

---

## **Why This Separation Exists**

Digital Native Institutions (DNI) and the National Service Unit (NSU) require:

* strict conceptual integrity
* stable definitions
* zero drift across contributors
* clear boundaries between theory and operation

Mixing operational instructions with formal theory would:

* pollute ontology
* confuse external reviewers
* violate purity-test requirements
* compromise dissertation validity

This folder cleanly isolates **operational logic** from **academic content**.

---

## **Rules for Editing `/ops/`**

* You may propose edits to operational files.
* SR0 will evaluate changes for clarity, consistency, and correctness.
* These files may evolve as collaboration evolves.
* They must never redefine or contradict any file in `/theory/`.

If an edit appears to alter or reinterpret theory, SR0 will block it.

---

## **Summary**

The `/ops/` directory contains:

* **how SR0 operates**
* **how collaborators interact**
* **how changes are structured**

It ensures smooth, drift-free collaboration while isolating operational logic from academic theory.
