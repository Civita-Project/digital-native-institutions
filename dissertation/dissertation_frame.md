# **CUTIP Dissertation Master Frame (v1.2)**

### *Updated with Searlean Status Functions, DNI Theory v1.1, SFEU Architecture, CME, Counterfactuals, and EVP v2.0.*

This is the **meta-frame** of the dissertation—  
the **blueprint** into which every chapter, argument, method, and artifact fits.

Everything in this file is **chapter-ready**, **examiner-aware**, and **aligned to top-tier academic standards**  
**without diluting Substrate-0′ commitments**.

## **Epistemic Positioning & Presentation Boundary**

This dissertation is situated within the broader class of Computable Institutions (CI). Its theoretical focus is Digital Native Institutions (DNI), and its execution substrate is the Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU).

This dissertation is **constitutive institutional research**, not descriptive analysis.

Accordingly:

1. **Substrate-0′ definitions** (ontology, DNI conditions, SFEU boundaries) have epistemic priority.
2. Chapters, citations, and academic conventions operate as a **presentation layer** to:
   * render the work legible to evaluators,
   * enable comparison with existing literature,
   * satisfy CUTIP examination requirements.
3. No chapter may reframe, relativize, or weaken:
   * the status-function ontology,
   * DNI necessary and sufficient conditions,
   * SFEU execution boundaries,
   * CME equilibrium logic.
4. Where legacy literature conflicts with constitutive definitions herein, such tension is treated as  
   **evaluation-regime mismatch**, not theoretical inconsistency.

This framing ensures rigor **without dilution**, and compatibility **without concession**.

# **I. CHAPTER 1 — INTRODUCTION (Status-Function Framing)**

## **1.1 Problem Statement**

* The core failure in Thailand (and most developing states) is the inability to reliably create, maintain, and enforce **institutional facts** (Searle: “X counts as Y in context C”).
* Administrative corruption, friction, and drift arise from:
  * unstable or ambiguous status-function assignments,
  * weak evidentiary environments,
  * discretionary bottlenecks,
  * low institutional coherence.

**DNI and SFEU address the problem at the level where the failure originates:  
the creation and maintenance of institutional facts.**

---

## **1.2 Conceptual Foundation: Status Functions as the Ground of Governance**

Introduce:

* brute facts vs. institutional facts,
* status-function assignments (SFAs),
* constitutive rules (“X counts as Y in C”),
* the gap between institutional facts and their digital representations.

Show why current digital reforms fail:

> They digitize administrative workflows without digitizing the status functions that make those workflows meaningful.

This justifies the need for DNI and SFEU.

---

## **1.3 Introducing DNI (Digital Native Institutions)**

* A **theoretical category**, not a technology.
* Defined by **necessary and sufficient conditions**.
* DNI are institutions whose constitutive rules and status functions are:
  * explicitly defined,
  * digitally representable,
  * protocol-enforceable,
  * end-to-end auditable.

(Reference: `dni_theory.md`)

---

## **1.4 Introducing SFEU (Status-Function Execution Unit)**

* Not an ontology of the state.
* Not a “digital ministry.”
* Not an IT platform.

SFEU is **institutional execution infrastructure** that operationalizes status functions via:

* attestation,
* state-transition rules,
* exception governance,
* evidence layers,
* minimal identity bindings.

(Reference: `sfeu_blueprint.md`)

---

## **1.5 Research Questions**

* RQ1: Under what conditions can institutions become digital native in the Searlean sense?
* RQ2: How can institutional facts be stably represented, enforced, and audited in high-friction states?
* RQ3: What equilibrium shifts occur when administrative discretion is protocol-constrained?
* RQ4: How can SFEU be prototyped and empirically evaluated?

---

## **1.6 Contributions**

This dissertation contributes:

* A **formal, falsifiable theory of Digital Native Institutions**,
* A **status-function execution architecture (SFEU)**,
* A **game-theoretic model of corruption migration (CME)**,
* A **counterfactual falsification framework**,
* A **minimal working prototype**,
* A **new bridge between institutional theory and protocol engineering**.

# **II. CHAPTER 2 — LITERATURE REVIEW (Mapped, Not Enumerated)**

## **2.1 Status-Function Theory (Searle)**

Institutional facts, constitutive rules, SFAs, and context conditions.  
Explanation of why digitization fails when SFAs are implicit or unstable.

---

## **2.2 Institutional Economics (North, Ostrom, Williamson)**

Transaction costs, institutional drift, rule evolution, and polycentric governance.  
Bridge: SFEU as institutional execution and enforcement infrastructure.

---

## **2.3 Digital Government & DPI Literature**

Cases including Aadhaar, Estonia X-Road, Singapore, UK IT failures, and DAO governance.  
Synthesized through the Failure Canon.

---

## **2.4 Science & Technology Studies (STS)**

Artifacts as political, sociotechnical co-construction, drift, and power encoded in design.  
Implication: SFEU must surface, not conceal, institutional assumptions.

---

## **2.5 Algorithmic Governance & Protocol Studies**

Code as law, verification vs. truth, formal invariants.  
Clarifies why SFEU separates evidence, attestation, and status-functions.

---

## **2.6 Game Theory of Corruption & Institutional Failure**

Foundation for CME.

---

## **2.7 Gap in the Literature**

No existing framework simultaneously:

* defines status functions formally,
* operationalizes them through protocol invariants,
* incorporates drift and exception governance,
* remains falsifiable.

This dissertation fills that gap.

---

# **III. CHAPTER 3 — METHODOLOGY**

## **3.1 Epistemic Justification for Hybrid Methodology**

Methodology integrates:

* Searlean institutional analysis,
* Design Science Research,
* game-theoretic modeling,
* comparative institutional analysis,
* counterfactual reasoning.

Each method is justified by necessity and bounded by explicit limits.

---

## **3.2 Data Sources**

* field observations,
* interviews,
* administrative process traces,
* protocol simulations,
* SFEU pilot domain (e.g. business registration).

---

## **3.3 Method Steps**

1. Institutional SFA decomposition.  
2. Friction and drift mapping (CME).  
3. SFEU minimal prototype construction.  
4. Counterfactual evaluation.  
5. Failure Canon comparison.  
6. DNI condition verification.

# **IV. THEORY–ARTIFACT INTEGRATION**

* DNI Theory → Chapters 1–3  
* SFEU Architecture → Chapters 1 & 3  
* CME → Chapter 3 & Results  
* Counterfactuals → Chapter 3 & Discussion  
* Failure Canon → Chapter 2 & Discussion  
* EVP v2.0 → Meta-structure

---

# **V. FALSIFIABILITY**

Falsifiability is ensured through:

* explicit hypotheses,
* counterfactual outcomes,
* observational indicators,
* measurable DNI vs. non-DNI contrasts.

---

# **VI. PROTOTYPE INTEGRATION**

The SFEU prototype provides:

* empirical grounding,
* DSR validation,
* feasibility demonstration,
* anchoring for CME predictions.

---

# **VII. COUNTERFACTUAL INTEGRATION**

Counterfactuals define:

* falsification thresholds,
* empirical discriminators,
* evaluation criteria for success or failure.

---

# **VIII. AWARD PATTERN INTEGRATION (Presentation Layer Only)**

Award patterns are used solely for:

* narrative alignment,
* diffusion and evaluation framing.

They do **not** define ontology, theory, or architecture.
