# **CUTIP Dissertation Master Frame (v1.0)**

### *Updated with Searlean Status Functions, DNI Theory v1.0, NSU Architecture, CME, Counterfactuals, and EVP v2.0.*

This is the **meta-frame** of the dissertation—
the **blueprint** into which every chapter, argument, method, and artifact fits.

Everything in this file is **chapter-ready**, **examiner-proof**, and **aligned to top-tier academic standards** while remaining true to the substrate-0/1 foundations.

---

# **I. CHAPTER 1 — INTRODUCTION (Updated with Status-Function Framing)**

## **1.1 Problem Statement (Rewritten)**

* The core failure in Thailand (and most developing states) is the inability to reliably create, maintain, and enforce **institutional facts** (Searle: “X counts as Y in context C”).
* Administrative corruption, friction, and drift arise from:

  * unstable or ambiguous status-function assignments
  * weak evidentiary environments
  * discretionary bottlenecks
  * low institutional coherence

**NSU and DNI address the problem at the level where the failure originates:
the *creation* and *maintenance* of institutional facts.**

---

## **1.2 Conceptual Foundation: Status Functions as the Ground of Governance**

Introduce:

* brute facts vs. institutional facts
* status-function assignments (SFAs)
* constitutive rules (“X counts as Y in C”)
* the gap between institutional facts and their digital representations

And show why current digital reforms fail:

> They digitize administrative workflows **without digitizing the status functions that make those workflows meaningful.**

This justifies the need for NSU and DNI.

---

## **1.3 Introducing DNI (Digital Native Institutions)**

* A **theoretical category** (not tech)
* Defined by **necessary and sufficient conditions**
* DNI = institutions whose constitutive rules and status functions are:

  * explicitly defined
  * representable in digital form
  * enforceable through protocol-bound transitions
  * auditable end-to-end

Here, reference Project File #2.

---

## **1.4 Introducing NSU (National Service Unit)**

* Not an ontology of the state
* Not a “digital ministry”
* Not an IT platform

NSU = **the institutional infrastructure that operationalizes status functions** using:

* attestation
* state-transition rules
* exception governance
* evidence layers
* minimal identity bindings

Reference Project File #7.

---

## **1.5 Research Questions**

Examples:

* RQ1: Under what conditions can national institutions become “digital native” in the Searlean sense?
* RQ2: How can institutional facts be stably represented, enforced, and audited in high-friction states?
* RQ3: What equilibrium changes occur when administrative discretion is protocol-constrained?
* RQ4: How can NSU be prototyped and empirically evaluated?

---

## **1.6 Contributions**

This dissertation contributes:

* A **formal, falsifiable theory of DNI**
* A **protocol-grounded architectural model (NSU)**
* A **game-theoretic model of corruption migration (CME)**
* A **counterfactual framework** for empirical discrimination
* A **minimal working prototype**
* A **new bridge between institutional theory and protocol engineering**

---

# **II. CHAPTER 2 — LITERATURE REVIEW (Updated with Canon + Maps)**

Chapter 2 now has a **coherent map**, not a list.

---

## **2.1 Status-Function Theory (Searle)**

Foundation of institutional facts, constitutive rules, SFAs, context conditions.
Bridge: why digital transformations fail → misaligned SFAs.

---

## **2.2 Institutional Economics (North, Ostrom, Williamson)**

* Transaction cost theory
* Institutional drift
* Rule evolution
* Polycentric governance

Bridge: NSU = institutional infrastructure that stabilizes rule enforcement.

---

## **2.3 Digital Government & DPI Literature**

* Aadhaar
* Estonia X-Road
* Singapore
* UK IT failures
* DAO governance failures

Bridge via Project File #9 (Failure Canon).
This is the empirical justification for NSU boundaries.

---

## **2.4 Science & Technology Studies (Winner, Latour, STS critique)**

* Artifacts have politics
* Sociotechnical co-construction
* Drift and adaptation
* Power encoded in design

Bridge: NSU must be designed to reveal, not hide, its political assumptions.

---

## **2.5 Algorithmic Governance & Protocol Studies**

* Code as Law (Lessig)
* Blockchain governance
* Formal protocol invariants
* Verification vs. truth

Bridge: why NSU separates **evidence**, **attestation**, and **status-functions**.

---

## **2.6 Game Theory of Corruption & Institutional Failure**

Bridge: CME model (Project File #3).

---

## **2.7 Gap in the Literature**

There is **no integrated framework** that:

* defines status functions formally
* operationalizes them through protocol invariants
* incorporates drift/adaptation
* includes exception governance
* is falsifiable

This is the open gap your dissertation fills.

---

# **III. CHAPTER 3 — METHODOLOGY (Corrected Epistemics)**

This is where most dissertations fail.
Yours becomes extremely strong.

---

## **3.1 Epistemic Justification for Hybrid Methodology**

Methodology now rests on a **triangulated epistemic foundation**:

### **(a) Searlean Institutional Analysis**

Clarifies:

* what institutional facts exist
* how they are constituted
* how they drift
* what can and cannot be digitized

### **(b) Design Science Research (DSR)**

Provides:

* artifact construction
* relevance → rigor cycles
* evaluation via prototypes

### **(c) Game-Theoretic Modeling**

Provides:

* equilibrium prediction
* corruption migration analysis

### **(d) Comparative Institutional Analysis**

Provides:

* cross-case testing via Failure Canon (File #9)

### **(e) Counterfactual Reasoning**

Provides:

* falsifiability
* testable implications
* empirical discriminators

The chapter argues **why each epistemic tool is necessary**
and **what each cannot do**.

---

## **3.2 Data Sources**

* field observations
* interviews
* administrative process traces
* protocol simulations
* NSU pilot domain (business registration)

---

## **3.3 Method Steps**

### **Step 1:** Institutional SFA decomposition

(Find all “X counts as Y in C” in the domain.)

### **Step 2:** Friction & drift mapping

Using CME.

### **Step 3:** Construct NSU Minimal Prototype

(Project file #5.)

### **Step 4:** Evaluate Against Counterfactual Framework

(Project file #4.)

### **Step 5:** Compare Against Failure Canon

(Project file #9.)

### **Step 6:** Assess If System Meets DNI Conditions

(Project file #8.)

---

# **IV. WHERE THEORY & ARTIFACTS SIT**

## **DNI Theory (File #2) → Chapter 1 + 2 + 3**

* Introduced in Chapter 1
* Theoretically framed & contrasted in Chapter 2
* Operationalized in Chapter 3

## **NSU (Files #5 + #7) → Chapter 1 + 3**

* Defined in Chapter 1
* Prototyped in Chapter 3

## **CME (File #3) → Chapter 3 + Results**

* Part of method & results interpretation

## **Counterfactuals (File #4) → Chapter 3 + Discussion**

* Grounds falsifiability

## **Failure Canon (File #9) → Chapter 2 + Discussion**

* Comparative logic

## **EVP v2.0 (File #6) → meta-structure**

* Ensures all chapters meet top-tier standards

---

# **V. HOW FALSIFIABILITY INTEGRATES**

Falsifiability is built through:

* explicit hypotheses (H1–H4)
* counterfactual outcomes
* observational indicators
* measurable differences between DNI vs. non-DNI domains

This transforms your dissertation from conceptual → scientific.

---

# **VI. HOW THE PROTOTYPE INTEGRATES**

The NSU minimal prototype:

* provides empirical evidence
* validates DSR
* demonstrates feasibility
* anchors the CME model
* proves status-function operationalization

This is essential at MIT-level rigor.

---

# **VII. HOW COUNTERFACTUALS INTEGRATE**

Counterfactuals determine:

* what would falsify DNI
* what would falsify NSU
* what empirical patterns differentiate them
* how to evaluate success/failure in the Thai context
