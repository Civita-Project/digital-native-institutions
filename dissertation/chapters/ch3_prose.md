### **3.0 Chapter Orientation: From Diagnosed Failure to Formal Inquiry**

This chapter establishes the **formal and methodological framing** required to investigate the execution-centered institutional failure identified in Chapter 1 and situated within the literature in Chapter 2. It does not propose solutions, designs, or interventions. Its function is to specify **how** claims about institutional execution can be made precise, testable, and falsifiable without collapsing into interpretation, policy advocacy, or narrative explanation.

Chapters 1 and 2 demonstrate that prevailing approaches to institutional reform and digital governance fail to address the core problem at the level where it originates: the **execution of institutional status functions**. Chapter 1 reframes this failure as an execution problem rather than a deficiency of intent, policy, or digitization. Chapter 2 shows that existing literatures—across institutional economics, digital government, algorithmic governance, and science and technology studies—lack a methodological apparatus capable of adjudicating execution-bound claims without either presuming discretionary interpretation or substituting governance with technology.

Given this gap, Chapter 3 specifies the **epistemic posture, analytical objects, and methodological constraints** necessary to study institutions whose claims depend on deterministic execution rather than interpretive judgment. The chapter clarifies what constitutes admissible evidence, what counts as falsification, and which domains are methodologically eligible for analysis under the dissertation’s commitments. In doing so, it establishes the conditions under which later empirical and artifact-based chapters can be evaluated without post hoc rationalization.

This chapter is deliberately **formal and preparatory**. It introduces no institutional designs, systems, or architectures. It presents no empirical material and advances no evaluative claims about effectiveness. Its sole purpose is to render subsequent analysis **methodologically legible and logically constrained**, ensuring that claims about institutional execution are assessed according to criteria fixed in advance.

Accordingly, Chapter 3 proceeds by: (i) clarifying the epistemic requirements imposed by execution-bound institutional claims; (ii) delimiting the formal object of analysis; (iii) introducing the evidence methodology compatible with those requirements; (iv) specifying falsification and counterfactual structure; and (v) declaring explicit scope and domain boundaries. With these elements in place, the dissertation is positioned to proceed to realization and evaluation without expanding or revising its theoretical commitments.

### **3.1 Epistemic Positioning and Methodological Requirements**

This section clarifies the **epistemic positioning** required to study institutions whose defining properties depend on execution rather than interpretation. It specifies the methodological requirements imposed by claims about institutional execution and delineates why conventional analytical approaches are insufficient under these constraints.

Institutional research traditionally oscillates between descriptive accounts of observed behavior and normative or interpretive explanations of institutional meaning. Such approaches are appropriate where institutional outcomes are mediated by discretionary judgment, cultural norms, or policy intent. However, they are inadequate for analyzing institutions whose validity claims hinge on whether administrative state transitions are executed deterministically according to formally specified rules. In such cases, institutional correctness is not established by narrative coherence, stakeholder perception, or outcome desirability, but by whether execution conforms to defined status-function mappings under explicit contextual constraints.

This dissertation therefore adopts an epistemic posture in which institutional claims are treated as **execution-contingent**. An institutional claim is admissible only insofar as it can be expressed as a proposition about the conditions under which a proposed institutional fact either holds or fails to hold, given observable execution traces. This posture rejects interpretive inference as a basis for validation and instead requires that institutional meaning be reconstructible from formally bound evidence, rule context, and execution records.

The methodological implication is that neither purely qualitative interpretation nor purely quantitative measurement is sufficient. Qualitative approaches privilege narrative sense-making but cannot adjudicate whether an execution-bound claim is satisfied without reintroducing discretion. Quantitative approaches, when detached from execution semantics, risk reducing institutional phenomena to proxy metrics that obscure failure modes rather than expose them. What is required instead is a methodology capable of preserving the distinction between brute facts, institutional facts, and contextual rules while rendering their interaction empirically observable.

Accordingly, methodological adequacy in this dissertation is defined by three requirements. First, the method must be **execution-sensitive**, meaning that it treats administrative actions as state transitions governed by explicit rules rather than as behavioral outcomes to be interpreted post hoc. Second, it must be **falsification-oriented**, such that claims can be shown to fail under specified counterconditions rather than being insulated by explanatory flexibility. Third, it must be **boundary-preserving**, ensuring that analytical claims do not collapse institutional form, execution substrate, and governance into a single explanatory layer.

This epistemic positioning does not assert superiority over alternative institutional research paradigms. Rather, it reflects a domain-specific necessity arising from the type of claims advanced in this dissertation. Where institutional validity is asserted to depend on execution correctness, the methodology must be capable of observing and discriminating execution states directly. The remainder of this chapter formalizes the analytical objects and methodological framework that satisfy these requirements, without extending the theoretical commitments established in earlier chapters.

### **3.2 Formal Object of Analysis: Institutional Execution Units**

This section defines the **formal object of analysis** for the dissertation in order to prevent category error and analytical drift. It specifies what is treated as observable, analyzable, and falsifiable when institutional claims are grounded in execution rather than interpretation.

The dissertation does not analyze institutions as abstract rule systems, organizational cultures, or aggregates of individual behavior. Nor does it treat digital systems as proxies for governance or policy intent. Instead, the object of analysis is the **execution of institutional status functions**, understood as formally specified transitions whereby a set of admissible inputs is transformed into an institutional fact under an explicit context. These transitions constitute the minimal unit at which institutional correctness can be evaluated when claims depend on deterministic execution.

Formally, an institutional execution unit is defined by three elements: (i) a set of admissible brute facts presented as evidence; (ii) a rule context specifying the conditions under which those facts may count as an institutional fact; and (iii) an execution outcome indicating whether the transition succeeded, failed, or emitted an explicit exception. The dissertation treats the trace of this transition—not the surrounding narrative or organizational justification—as the primary empirical object.

This delimitation requires a strict separation between institutional form and execution substrate. Institutional form specifies what kinds of status functions exist and under what conditions they are valid. The execution substrate specifies how those conditions are enforced and how transitions are recorded. Analytical claims are directed at the interaction between these layers only insofar as it is rendered observable through execution traces. Governance, interpretation, and adjudication are not treated as execution phenomena and are therefore excluded from the object of analysis at this stage.

By fixing the object of analysis in this manner, the dissertation excludes several common but incompatible approaches. It does not infer institutional meaning from outcomes, stakeholder satisfaction, or aggregate performance indicators. It does not treat software systems as institutions in themselves. It does not evaluate correctness by appeal to policy goals or normative expectations. Any claim that cannot be expressed as a proposition about the execution of a defined institutional transition is methodologically inadmissible within this framework.

This formalization is necessary to support later falsification. If institutional claims are not anchored to execution units with explicit success and failure conditions, they cannot be shown to be false without recourse to interpretive discretion. By contrast, when the object of analysis is fixed as an execution unit with reconstructible traces, institutional claims can be evaluated against criteria specified in advance. The following sections build on this definition to introduce the evidence methodology and falsification structure compatible with such objects of analysis.
