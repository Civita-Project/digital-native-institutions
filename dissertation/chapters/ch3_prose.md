### **3.0 Chapter Orientation: From Diagnosed Failure to Formal Inquiry**

This chapter establishes the **formal and methodological framing** required to investigate the execution-centered institutional failure identified in Chapter 1 and situated within the literature in Chapter 2. It does not propose solutions, designs, or interventions. Its function is to specify **how** claims about institutional execution can be made precise, testable, and falsifiable without collapsing into interpretation, policy advocacy, or narrative explanation.

Chapters 1 and 2 demonstrate that prevailing approaches to institutional reform and digital governance fail to address the core problem at the level where it originates: the **execution of institutional status functions**. Chapter 1 reframes this failure as an execution problem rather than a deficiency of intent, policy, or digitization. Chapter 2 shows that existing literatures—across institutional economics, digital government, algorithmic governance, and science and technology studies—lack a methodological apparatus capable of adjudicating execution-bound claims without either presuming discretionary interpretation or substituting governance with technology.

Given this gap, Chapter 3 specifies the **epistemic posture, analytical objects, and methodological constraints** necessary to study institutions whose claims depend on deterministic execution rather than interpretive judgment. The chapter clarifies what constitutes admissible evidence, what counts as falsification, and which domains are methodologically eligible for analysis under the dissertation’s commitments. In doing so, it establishes the conditions under which later empirical and artifact-based chapters can be evaluated without post hoc rationalization.

This chapter is deliberately **formal and preparatory**. It introduces no institutional designs, systems, or architectures. It presents no empirical material and advances no evaluative claims about effectiveness. Its sole purpose is to render subsequent analysis **methodologically legible and logically constrained**, ensuring that claims about institutional execution are assessed according to criteria fixed in advance.

Accordingly, Chapter 3 proceeds by: (i) clarifying the epistemic requirements imposed by execution-bound institutional claims; (ii) delimiting the formal object of analysis; (iii) introducing the evidence methodology compatible with those requirements; (iv) specifying falsification and counterfactual structure; and (v) declaring explicit scope and domain boundaries. With these elements in place, the dissertation is positioned to proceed to realization and evaluation without expanding or revising its theoretical commitments.

### **3.1 Epistemic Positioning and Methodological Requirements**

This section clarifies the **epistemic positioning** required to study institutions whose defining properties depend on execution rather than interpretation. It specifies the methodological requirements imposed by claims about institutional execution and delineates why conventional analytical approaches are insufficient under these constraints.

Institutional research traditionally oscillates between descriptive accounts of observed behavior and normative or interpretive explanations of institutional meaning. Such approaches are appropriate where institutional outcomes are mediated by discretionary judgment, cultural norms, or policy intent. However, they are inadequate for analyzing institutions whose validity claims hinge on whether administrative state transitions are executed deterministically according to formally specified rules. In such cases, institutional correctness is not established by narrative coherence, stakeholder perception, or outcome desirability, but by whether execution conforms to defined status-function mappings under explicit contextual constraints.

This dissertation therefore adopts an epistemic posture in which institutional claims are treated as **execution-contingent**. An institutional claim is admissible only insofar as it can be expressed as a proposition about the conditions under which a proposed institutional fact either holds or fails to hold, given observable execution traces. This posture rejects interpretive inference as a basis for validation and instead requires that institutional meaning be reconstructible from formally bound evidence, rule context, and execution records.

The methodological implication is that neither purely qualitative interpretation nor purely quantitative measurement is sufficient. Qualitative approaches privilege narrative sense-making but cannot adjudicate whether an execution-bound claim is satisfied without reintroducing discretion. Quantitative approaches, when detached from execution semantics, risk reducing institutional phenomena to proxy metrics that obscure failure modes rather than expose them. What is required instead is a methodology capable of preserving the distinction between brute facts, institutional facts, and contextual rules while rendering their interaction empirically observable.

Accordingly, methodological adequacy in this dissertation is defined by three requirements. First, the method must be **execution-sensitive**, meaning that it treats administrative actions as state transitions governed by explicit rules rather than as behavioral outcomes to be interpreted post hoc. Second, it must be **falsification-oriented**, such that claims can be shown to fail under specified counterconditions rather than being insulated by explanatory flexibility. Third, it must be **boundary-preserving**, ensuring that analytical claims do not collapse institutional form, execution substrate, and governance into a single explanatory layer.

This epistemic positioning does not assert superiority over alternative institutional research paradigms. Rather, it reflects a domain-specific necessity arising from the type of claims advanced in this dissertation. Where institutional validity is asserted to depend on execution correctness, the methodology must be capable of observing and discriminating execution states directly. The remainder of this chapter formalizes the analytical objects and methodological framework that satisfy these requirements, without extending the theoretical commitments established in earlier chapters.

### **3.2 Formal Object of Analysis: Institutional Execution Units**

This section defines the **formal object of analysis** for the dissertation in order to prevent category error and analytical drift. It specifies what is treated as observable, analyzable, and falsifiable when institutional claims are grounded in execution rather than interpretation.

The dissertation does not analyze institutions as abstract rule systems, organizational cultures, or aggregates of individual behavior. Nor does it treat digital systems as proxies for governance or policy intent. Instead, the object of analysis is the **execution of institutional status functions**, understood as formally specified transitions whereby a set of admissible inputs is transformed into an institutional fact under an explicit context. These transitions constitute the minimal unit at which institutional correctness can be evaluated when claims depend on deterministic execution.

Formally, an institutional execution unit is defined by three elements: (i) a set of admissible brute facts presented as evidence; (ii) a rule context specifying the conditions under which those facts may count as an institutional fact; and (iii) an execution outcome indicating whether the transition succeeded, failed, or emitted an explicit exception. The dissertation treats the trace of this transition—not the surrounding narrative or organizational justification—as the primary empirical object.

This delimitation requires a strict separation between institutional form and execution substrate. Institutional form specifies what kinds of status functions exist and under what conditions they are valid. The execution substrate specifies how those conditions are enforced and how transitions are recorded. Analytical claims are directed at the interaction between these layers only insofar as it is rendered observable through execution traces. Governance, interpretation, and adjudication are not treated as execution phenomena and are therefore excluded from the object of analysis at this stage.

By fixing the object of analysis in this manner, the dissertation excludes several common but incompatible approaches. It does not infer institutional meaning from outcomes, stakeholder satisfaction, or aggregate performance indicators. It does not treat software systems as institutions in themselves. It does not evaluate correctness by appeal to policy goals or normative expectations. Any claim that cannot be expressed as a proposition about the execution of a defined institutional transition is methodologically inadmissible within this framework.

This formalization is necessary to support later falsification. If institutional claims are not anchored to execution units with explicit success and failure conditions, they cannot be shown to be false without recourse to interpretive discretion. By contrast, when the object of analysis is fixed as an execution unit with reconstructible traces, institutional claims can be evaluated against criteria specified in advance. The following sections build on this definition to introduce the evidence methodology and falsification structure compatible with such objects of analysis.

### **3.3 Methodological Framework: Digital-Native Methodology (DNM)**

This section introduces **Digital-Native Methodology (DNM)** as the evidence methodology required to evaluate execution-bound institutional claims, without specifying procedures, instruments, or empirical applications. DNM is presented here strictly as a **methodological constraint**, not as a research technique or design prescription.

DNM is required because the institutional claims advanced in this dissertation depend on the correctness of execution rather than on interpretive coherence or outcome desirability. Where institutional validity hinges on whether defined status-function transitions are executed according to explicit rules and context, evidence must be generated in a form that preserves those distinctions. Methodologies that rely on narrative reconstruction, researcher interpretation, or proxy indicators are insufficient, as they reintroduce discretion at the point where determinism is claimed.

Under DNM, admissible evidence is limited to artifacts that are **natively produced by institutional execution**. Such evidence must allow an independent observer to reconstruct, without interpretive supplementation, whether a claimed institutional transition occurred, failed, or emitted an exception under a specified rule context. The role of the researcher is not to infer institutional meaning, but to verify whether execution traces satisfy the conditions implied by the claim. Evidence that cannot support such reconstruction is excluded by methodological design, regardless of its descriptive richness.

DNM differs from conventional qualitative and quantitative methodologies in its treatment of interpretation. Qualitative methods privilege contextual understanding but cannot adjudicate execution correctness without substituting interpretation for enforcement. Quantitative methods can measure frequency, latency, or variance, but without execution semantics they risk abstracting away the very conditions under which institutional facts are constituted. DNM constrains both by requiring that any admissible observation be directly traceable to a formally executed transition.

Importantly, DNM does not assert that execution-native evidence is universally superior to other forms of institutional evidence. Its applicability is explicitly bounded to domains in which institutions claim to be digital native in the constitutive sense articulated earlier in the dissertation. Where institutional execution remains discretionary, opaque, or non-computable, DNM is inapplicable and no evaluative claim is made. The methodology therefore derives its force not from generality, but from alignment with the type of institutional claims under examination.

By introducing DNM at this stage, the dissertation fixes the evidentiary standards prior to any empirical or artifact-based analysis. Subsequent chapters are evaluated against these standards, not retrofitted to them. This ordering ensures that later observations can function as genuine tests of the theory rather than as post hoc illustrations.

### **3.4 Falsification Logic and Counterfactual Structure**

This section specifies the **falsification logic** governing execution-bound institutional claims and explains why counterfactual reasoning is structurally required rather than methodologically optional. Its purpose is to fix, in advance, the conditions under which claims made in later chapters would be considered false.

When institutional validity is asserted to depend on deterministic execution, falsification cannot be established through interpretive disagreement or outcome dissatisfaction. A claim is falsified only if the execution behavior observed under defined conditions contradicts what the claim requires. This necessitates a falsification framework that operates directly on execution traces and that distinguishes theory failure from implementation failure without recourse to narrative explanation.

Counterfactual structure provides this framework. Execution-bound claims implicitly assert not only what should occur in the observed world, but also what would occur in relevant alternative worlds. These alternatives are not hypothetical narratives; they are formally constrained variations in execution conditions, rule context, or observability. A claim is meaningful only if it implies a detectable difference between the observed world and at least one counterfactual world that is admissible under the same institutional constraints.

Accordingly, this dissertation treats counterfactuals as **structural discriminators**. Each counterfactual class specifies a distinct way in which execution could deviate from what is claimed while remaining within the domain of computable institutions. The purpose of these counterfactuals is not to imagine different policy choices or social outcomes, but to test whether execution-level invariants hold when confronted with alternative but permissible execution conditions. If a claim cannot be differentiated across such counterfactuals, it is not falsifiable and is therefore methodologically invalid.

This approach also enforces a strict separation between theory failure and implementation failure. Where execution deviates from the claim due to hidden discretion, suppressed failure, or interpretive substitution, the failure is attributed to violation of execution constraints rather than to the underlying theory. Conversely, where execution conforms to all declared constraints but the predicted institutional behavior does not materialize, the theory itself is falsified. Counterfactual structure is what makes this distinction observable rather than rhetorical.

By fixing falsification logic at this stage, the dissertation precludes post hoc adjustment of success criteria. Claims advanced later are evaluated against counterfactual conditions specified in advance, and failure is treated as informative rather than exceptional. This orientation is necessary to preserve the epistemic integrity of execution-centered institutional research and to ensure that subsequent chapters function as tests rather than demonstrations.
