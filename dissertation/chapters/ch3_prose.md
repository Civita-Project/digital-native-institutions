### **3.0 Chapter Orientation: From Diagnosed Failure to Formal Inquiry**

This chapter establishes the **formal and methodological framing** required to investigate the execution-centered institutional failure identified in Chapter 1 and situated within the literature in Chapter 2. It does not propose solutions, designs, or interventions. Its function is to specify **how** claims about institutional execution can be made precise, testable, and falsifiable without collapsing into interpretation, policy advocacy, or narrative explanation.

Chapters 1 and 2 demonstrate that prevailing approaches to institutional reform and digital governance fail to address the core problem at the level where it originates: the **execution of institutional status functions**. Chapter 1 reframes this failure as an execution problem rather than a deficiency of intent, policy, or digitization. Chapter 2 shows that existing literatures—across institutional economics, digital government, algorithmic governance, and science and technology studies—lack a methodological apparatus capable of adjudicating execution-bound claims without either presuming discretionary interpretation or substituting governance with technology.

Given this gap, Chapter 3 specifies the **epistemic posture, analytical objects, and methodological constraints** necessary to study institutions whose claims depend on deterministic execution rather than interpretive judgment. The chapter clarifies what constitutes admissible evidence, what counts as falsification, and which domains are methodologically eligible for analysis under the dissertation’s commitments. In doing so, it establishes the conditions under which later empirical and artifact-based chapters can be evaluated without post hoc rationalization.

This chapter is deliberately **formal and preparatory**. It introduces no institutional designs, systems, or architectures. It presents no empirical material and advances no evaluative claims about effectiveness. Its sole purpose is to render subsequent analysis **methodologically legible and logically constrained**, ensuring that claims about institutional execution are assessed according to criteria fixed in advance.

Accordingly, Chapter 3 proceeds by: (i) clarifying the epistemic requirements imposed by execution-bound institutional claims; (ii) delimiting the formal object of analysis; (iii) introducing the evidence methodology compatible with those requirements; (iv) specifying falsification and counterfactual structure; and (v) declaring explicit scope and domain boundaries. With these elements in place, the dissertation is positioned to proceed to realization and evaluation without expanding or revising its theoretical commitments.
