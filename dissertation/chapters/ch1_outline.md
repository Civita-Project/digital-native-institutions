# Chapter 1 — Institutional Failure as a Problem of Status-Function Execution

## Chapter Intent
Establish that systemic administrative failure originates from unstable execution of institutional facts (status-function assignments), not from corruption, inefficiency, or insufficient digitization, thereby motivating the need for a computable institutional approach without introducing solutions.

---

## 1.1 Institutional Problem Statement
**Intent:**  
Reframe commonly observed governance failures as failures in the reliable creation, execution, and recording of institutional facts.

**In-scope:**
- Institutional failure framed as instability of institutional facts
- Distinction between symptoms (corruption, delay, opacity) and structural cause
- Status-function instability as the shared root condition
- Limits of enforcement- or integrity-based explanations

**Out-of-scope:**
- Policy critique
- Moral framing
- Solution preview
- Country-specific cultural explanations

---

## 1.2 Conceptual Foundation: Status Functions as the Ground of Governance
**Intent:**  
Establish status-function assignments (“X counts as Y in C”) as the correct primitive for analyzing governance and administration.

**In-scope:**
- Institutional facts vs brute facts
- Governance as execution of status functions
- Dependence of institutional reliability on executable status rules
- Conceptual inadequacy of procedure-only or organization-centric models

**Out-of-scope:**
- Digital Native Institutions
- Execution machinery
- Technological implementation

---

## 1.3 Limits of Conventional Digitization and E-Government Reforms
**Intent:**  
Demonstrate that digitization of workflows does not resolve institutional failure when status-function execution remains discretionary.

**In-scope:**
- Digitization as representation without execution constraint
- Persistence of discretion despite digital systems
- Separation between procedural automation and institutional fact enforcement
- Why efficiency gains do not imply institutional stability

**Out-of-scope:**
- Technology evaluation
- UX or service quality
- Specific system architectures

---

## 1.4 Discretion, Opacity, and Institutional Drift
**Intent:**  
Explain how discretionary execution of status functions produces institutional drift, opacity, and non-reconstructible outcomes.

**In-scope:**
- Discretion as structural, not individual, phenomenon
- Drift as divergence between formal rules and executed outcomes
- Audit failure as consequence of non-deterministic execution
- Reproducibility as a criterion for institutional reliability

**Out-of-scope:**
- Blame attribution
- Anti-corruption mechanisms
- Legal reform proposals

---

## 1.5 High-Friction States as Stress Environments
**Intent:**  
Justify the analytical focus on high-friction administrative environments as observationally rich contexts rather than exceptional cases.

**In-scope:**
- High-friction states as stress tests for institutional design
- Visibility of institutional instability under load
- Thailand used illustratively, not explanatorily
- Generalizability of structural failure patterns

**Out-of-scope:**
- National case study
- Historical narrative
- Comparative country rankings

---

## 1.6 Problem Restatement and Analytical Boundary
**Intent:**  
Restate the institutional problem in execution-level terms and define the analytical boundary for the remainder of the dissertation.

**In-scope:**
- Formal restatement of the problem as execution failure
- Explicit exclusion of policy, culture, and ethics as primary explanatory layers
- Clarification of what the dissertation will and will not attempt to solve
- Transition to computable institutional framing (without solution detail)

**Out-of-scope:**
- Introduction of DNI
- Execution substrates
- Methodology discussion

---

## Chapter 1 Closure Condition
Chapter 1 is complete when:
- Institutional failure is clearly framed as a status-function execution problem
- Digitization is shown to be insufficient at the conceptual level
- No solution mechanisms are introduced
- Analytical boundaries are explicit and stable
