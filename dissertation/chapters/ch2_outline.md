# **Chapter 2 Outline — Literature Review (Mapped, Not Enumerated)**

---

## **2.0 Chapter Orientation: Literature Relative to Execution Failure**

**Intent:**
Orient the reader to how existing literature will be *read*, not what it proves, using the execution-centered problem framing established in Chapter 1.

**In-scope:**

* Restatement of the Chapter 1 problem in literature-mapping terms
* Explicit claim: literature explains institutions *around* execution, not *at* execution
* Clarification that this chapter maps explanatory limits, not theoretical solutions
* Explanation of “mapped, not enumerated” review logic

**Explicitly out-of-scope:**

* Introduction of new institutional constructs
* Formal hierarchies or typologies
* Any proposal, model, or solution
* Validation or critique of specific authors

**CUTIP examiner reassurance sentence (to be used in prose later):**

* Literature is treated as *necessary background*, not as constitutive authority

## **2.1 Status Functions and Institutional Facts**

**Intent:**
Provide the minimal conceptual grounding required to discuss institutions as rule-producing systems, anchoring the execution framing without advancing new theory.

**In-scope:**

* Distinction between brute facts and institutional facts
* Status functions as the mechanism by which institutional facts arise
* “X counts as Y in context C” as an analytical form, not a design prescription
* Why institutional analysis presupposes this distinction, often implicitly

**Boundary conditions (must be explicit):**

* This section **does not** explain how status functions are executed
* This section **does not** propose mechanisms or systems
* This section **does not** privilege philosophy over economics or governance

**Out-of-scope:**

* Digital institutions
* Execution substrates
* Deterministic enforcement
* Corruption models
* Any claim that existing theory is “wrong”

**Purpose relative to dissertation flow:**

* Establishes the *conceptual floor* shared by all later literatures
* Makes later execution-level gaps legible without asserting solutions
