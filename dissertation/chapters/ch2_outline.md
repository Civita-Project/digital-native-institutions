# **Chapter 2 Outline — Literature Review (Mapped, Not Enumerated)**

---

## **2.0 Chapter Orientation: Literature Relative to Execution Failure**

**Intent:**
Orient the reader to how existing literature will be *read*, not what it proves, using the execution-centered problem framing established in Chapter 1.

**In-scope:**

* Restatement of the Chapter 1 problem in literature-mapping terms
* Explicit claim: literature explains institutions *around* execution, not *at* execution
* Clarification that this chapter maps explanatory limits, not theoretical solutions
* Explanation of “mapped, not enumerated” review logic

**Explicitly out-of-scope:**

* Introduction of new institutional constructs
* Formal hierarchies or typologies
* Any proposal, model, or solution
* Validation or critique of specific authors

**CUTIP examiner reassurance sentence (to be used in prose later):**

* Literature is treated as *necessary background*, not as constitutive authority

---

## **2.1 Status Functions and Institutional Facts**

**Intent:**
Provide the minimal conceptual grounding required to discuss institutions as rule-producing systems, anchoring the execution framing without advancing new theory.

**In-scope:**

* Distinction between brute facts and institutional facts
* Status functions as the mechanism by which institutional facts arise
* “X counts as Y in context C” as an analytical form, not a design prescription
* Why institutional analysis presupposes this distinction, often implicitly

**Boundary conditions (must be explicit):**

* This section **does not** explain how status functions are executed
* This section **does not** propose mechanisms or systems
* This section **does not** privilege philosophy over economics or governance

**Out-of-scope:**

* Digital institutions
* Execution substrates
* Deterministic enforcement
* Corruption models
* Any claim that existing theory is “wrong”

**Purpose relative to dissertation flow:**

* Establishes the *conceptual floor* shared by all later literatures
* Makes later execution-level gaps legible without asserting solutions

## **2.2 Institutional Economics and Rule Enforcement**

**Intent:**  
Map institutional economics literature to the execution gap identified in Chapter 1, clarifying what these theories explain and where they structurally stop short of executional reliability.

**In-scope:**
- Institutions as rule systems governing behavior (e.g., North)
- Enforcement, transaction costs, and institutional stability
- Institutional drift over time under changing incentives
- Polycentric governance as descriptive context for complexity, not as a solution

**Explicit boundaries (must be stated in prose):**
- Institutional economics explains incentives, constraints, and coordination
- It does not specify how institutional facts are executed deterministically
- It does not provide mechanisms for execution reproducibility or audit reconstruction

**Out-of-scope:**
- Welfare economics and efficiency optimization
- Market design or regulatory reform proposals
- Empirical claims of policy effectiveness
- Claims about optimal institutional design or reform success

**Role in chapter flow:**
- Demonstrates that dominant economic theories account for behavior and rules
- Makes visible the missing execution primitive without critiquing intent or rigor

## **2.3 Digitization, E-Government, and Administrative IT**

**Intent:**  
Map digitization and e-government literature to the execution/representation distinction, clarifying why administrative IT reforms often fail to stabilize institutional facts despite gains in efficiency and access.

**In-scope:**
- Digitization as representation of actions, documents, and procedures
- E-government goals: efficiency, transparency, service delivery
- Persistence of discretion behind digital interfaces
- Distinction between procedural automation and institutional outcome determination
- Audit and reconstruction limits in digitally mediated systems

**Explicit boundaries (must be stated in prose):**
- Digitization constrains processes, not the execution of institutional facts
- Validation rules and workflows do not guarantee institutional validity
- Digital records do not ensure reconstructible execution paths

**Out-of-scope:**
- Country rankings or benchmark comparisons
- Implementation success stories or best-practice narratives
- Evaluation of specific technologies or system architectures
- Reform recommendations or alternative digital designs

**Role in chapter flow:**
- Demonstrates that digitization addresses how tasks are performed
- Makes explicit why execution instability persists under digital reform
- Prepares the ground for sociotechnical explanations without endorsing them


---

## **2.4 Sociotechnical Systems and Institutional Drift**

**Intent:**  
Acknowledge sociotechnical explanations of institutional behavior while delimiting their explanatory scope, showing why such accounts describe the manifestation of discretion and drift without providing mechanisms for executional stability.

**In-scope:**
- Institutions as sociotechnical systems combining formal rules, artifacts, and human practice
- How informal workarounds and embedded assumptions emerge under discretionary execution
- Sociotechnical accounts of institutional drift and divergence between formal rules and outcomes
- Opacity arising from under-specified execution rather than from information absence

**Explicit boundaries (must be stated in prose):**
- Sociotechnical explanations describe *how* discretion manifests, not *why* it structurally exists
- Drift is amplified by human–artifact interaction but originates in unconstrained execution
- Executional reliability cannot be achieved through cultural alignment or informal practice

**Out-of-scope:**
- Cultural determinism or national character explanations
- Actor–network theory expansion or generalized STS critique
- Normative evaluation of institutional legitimacy or power
- Claims that technology or social engineering can replace governance

**Role in chapter flow:**
- Complements digitization and economic literatures by explaining observed persistence of drift
- Clarifies why sociotechnical insight alone cannot resolve execution instability
- Prepares the transition to formal execution-focused frameworks in later chapters

## **2.5 Algorithmic Governance and Protocol Studies**

**Intent:**  
Differentiate algorithmic and code-based governance approaches from execution-centered institutional analysis, clarifying why decision-making automation and rule formalization do not constitute executional reliability.

**In-scope:**
- Algorithmic governance as the formalization and automation of rules and decisions
- “Code is law” discourse as a contrast class for institutional enforcement
- Distinction between algorithmic interpretation and protocol enforcement
- Verification and compliance checking versus judgment and outcome selection
- Formal invariants contrasted with optimization or adaptive logic

**Explicit boundaries (must be stated in prose):**
- Algorithms and code-based systems interpret inputs and select outcomes
- Protocols enforce declared outcomes but do not decide cases
- Execution must remain non-interpretive and non-adaptive
- Governance authority cannot be delegated to code or automation

**Out-of-scope:**
- AI ethics and normative debates about automation
- Machine learning, probabilistic, or adaptive decision systems
- Autonomous governance or “smart” institutions
- Evaluation of specific platforms, blockchains, or technical stacks

**Role in chapter flow:**
- Clarifies why formalization alone does not stabilize institutional facts
- Prevents conflation of execution with automated decision-making
- Prepares the ground for introducing execution-focused frameworks in later chapters

## **2.6 Corruption as Strategic Behavior under Discretion**

**Intent:**  
Map corruption literature as an analytical account of strategic behavior that emerges under discretionary and opaque execution environments, without moral judgment, measurement claims, or introduction of equilibrium models.

**In-scope:**
- Corruption framed as rational, strategic behavior given discretionary execution
- Exploitation of opacity, weak enforcement, and ambiguous status assignment
- Coordination, signaling, and risk-sharing dynamics among participants
- Persistence of corruption despite procedural reform and digitization

**Explicit boundaries (must be stated in prose):**
- Analytical framing only; no moral evaluation or justification
- Discretion treated as a structural precondition, not an outcome of incentives
- Corruption explains behavior *within* execution gaps; it does not explain why gaps exist
- No equilibrium, migration, or systemic model introduced here

**Out-of-scope:**
- Cultural or national-character explanations
- Ethical condemnation or normative prescriptions
- Anti-corruption policy toolkits or reform programs
- Measurement frameworks, indices, rankings, or empirical proxies

**Role in chapter flow:**
- Positions corruption literature as descriptive of behavior under discretion
- Demonstrates why corruption persists absent executional constraints
- Prepares a clean transition to the formal literature gap without solution leakage
