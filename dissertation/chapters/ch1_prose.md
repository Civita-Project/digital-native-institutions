## **1.1 Institutional Problem Statement**

Contemporary administrative failure is commonly attributed to corruption, inefficiency, lack of capacity, or incomplete digitization. These explanations, while descriptively familiar, misidentify symptoms as causes. They focus on observable pathologies in institutional outcomes without accounting for the structural conditions that make such outcomes recurrent, resilient, and resistant to reform.

At a more fundamental level, administrative institutions fail when they cannot reliably create, execute, and preserve **institutional facts**. An institutional fact exists when a brute fact is successfully recognized as having a specific status within an institutional context. Governance and administration consist precisely in the repeated production and maintenance of such facts: licenses issued, registrations granted, obligations recorded, entitlements recognized. When these facts are unstable, inconsistently applied, or non-reconstructible, institutional performance degrades regardless of formal rules, stated policies, or declared reforms.

From this perspective, corruption, delay, opacity, and arbitrariness are not primary failures. They are downstream manifestations of a deeper instability in how institutional statuses are assigned and enforced. When the conditions under which a given action or artifact counts as an institutional outcome are ambiguous, discretionary, or inconsistently executed, institutional facts lose determinacy. The resulting environment permits divergent outcomes under nominally identical rules, undermining predictability, auditability, and trust.

Importantly, this instability is structural rather than individual. It does not depend on the moral quality, intent, or competence of specific officials. Instead, it arises when institutional systems lack mechanisms that reliably constrain how status assignments are produced, recorded, and verified. In such systems, correct outcomes may occur, but they do so contingently rather than systematically. Failures therefore recur even when personnel change, procedures are rewritten, or digital interfaces are introduced.

This reframing has significant implications. If institutional failure is rooted in the unstable execution of institutional facts, then reforms that target behavior, incentives, or surface-level efficiency cannot address the underlying problem. Without reliable execution of status-function assignments, improvements remain local, temporary, or symbolic. Administrative systems may appear modernized while retaining the same structural fragilities that generated failure in the first place.

Accordingly, this dissertation treats institutional failure not as a problem of corruption control, organizational design, or technological adoption, but as a problem of executional reliability at the level where institutional facts are produced. This reframing establishes the analytical foundation for the remainder of the chapter and motivates a shift away from symptom-focused explanations toward an execution-centered understanding of governance breakdown.


## **1.2 Conceptual Foundation: Status Functions as the Ground of Governance**

Governance and administration operate through the creation and maintenance of **institutional facts**, not merely through the execution of procedures or the operation of organizations. Institutional facts differ categorically from brute facts. A brute fact exists independently of social recognition, whereas an institutional fact exists only insofar as a collective framework assigns a specific status and effect to some underlying action, artifact, or record. This distinction is foundational for understanding how institutions function and why they fail.

Institutional facts arise through **status-function assignments**, commonly expressed in the form “X counts as Y in context C.” In administrative settings, X may be a document, declaration, or action; Y is the institutional status produced, such as a registration, license, or entitlement; and C is the rule-governed context in which the assignment is valid. Governance consists in the repeated execution of these assignments across time, cases, and actors. When such assignments are applied consistently, institutional order emerges. When they are not, institutional coherence deteriorates.

This framing shifts attention away from organizations and procedures as primary analytical units. Organizational charts describe who is authorized to act, and procedures describe sequences of actions, but neither specifies what must reliably occur for an institutional fact to be created and recognized. A process may be followed correctly in form while still failing to produce a stable institutional outcome if the conditions under which X counts as Y remain implicit, discretionary, or inconsistently applied. As a result, procedural compliance does not guarantee institutional validity.

The reliability of governance therefore depends not on the existence of rules alone, but on the stability with which status functions are executed. Where the mapping between underlying actions and institutional outcomes is weakly specified or variably enforced, identical cases can yield divergent results without any formal rule violation. Such divergence undermines predictability and makes institutional behavior difficult to reconstruct after the fact. The problem is not the absence of rules, but the absence of mechanisms that ensure those rules are executed in a determinate and traceable manner.

Conventional models of administrative reform often treat governance as a coordination or optimization problem: improve incentives, streamline workflows, clarify responsibilities, or increase transparency. While such interventions may improve local performance, they do not address the more basic question of whether institutional facts themselves are being produced in a stable way. Without a clear analytical account of how status functions are assigned and maintained, reforms risk improving surface efficiency while leaving the core sources of institutional instability intact.

Accordingly, this chapter adopts status functions as the primitive unit of analysis for governance and administration. By grounding institutional analysis in the conditions under which institutional facts come into existence, it becomes possible to explain why similar reforms produce divergent outcomes across contexts, and why failures persist despite repeated procedural or organizational change. This conceptual foundation establishes the basis for evaluating administrative systems in terms of their capacity to execute status-function assignments reliably, rather than in terms of their formal structure or stated intent.
