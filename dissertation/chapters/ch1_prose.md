## **1.1 Institutional Problem Statement**

Contemporary administrative failure is commonly attributed to corruption, inefficiency, lack of capacity, or incomplete digitization. These explanations, while descriptively familiar, misidentify symptoms as causes. They focus on observable pathologies in institutional outcomes without accounting for the structural conditions that make such outcomes recurrent, resilient, and resistant to reform.

At a more fundamental level, administrative institutions fail when they cannot reliably create, execute, and preserve **institutional facts**. An institutional fact exists when a brute fact is successfully recognized as having a specific status within an institutional context. Governance and administration consist precisely in the repeated production and maintenance of such facts: licenses issued, registrations granted, obligations recorded, entitlements recognized. When these facts are unstable, inconsistently applied, or non-reconstructible, institutional performance degrades regardless of formal rules, stated policies, or declared reforms.

From this perspective, corruption, delay, opacity, and arbitrariness are not primary failures. They are downstream manifestations of a deeper instability in how institutional statuses are assigned and enforced. When the conditions under which a given action or artifact counts as an institutional outcome are ambiguous, discretionary, or inconsistently executed, institutional facts lose determinacy. The resulting environment permits divergent outcomes under nominally identical rules, undermining predictability, auditability, and trust.

Importantly, this instability is structural rather than individual. It does not depend on the moral quality, intent, or competence of specific officials. Instead, it arises when institutional systems lack mechanisms that reliably constrain how status assignments are produced, recorded, and verified. In such systems, correct outcomes may occur, but they do so contingently rather than systematically. Failures therefore recur even when personnel change, procedures are rewritten, or digital interfaces are introduced.

This reframing has significant implications. If institutional failure is rooted in the unstable execution of institutional facts, then reforms that target behavior, incentives, or surface-level efficiency cannot address the underlying problem. Without reliable execution of status-function assignments, improvements remain local, temporary, or symbolic. Administrative systems may appear modernized while retaining the same structural fragilities that generated failure in the first place.

Accordingly, this dissertation treats institutional failure not as a problem of corruption control, organizational design, or technological adoption, but as a problem of executional reliability at the level where institutional facts are produced. This reframing establishes the analytical foundation for the remainder of the chapter and motivates a shift away from symptom-focused explanations toward an execution-centered understanding of governance breakdown.
