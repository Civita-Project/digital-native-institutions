### **2.0 Chapter Orientation: Literature Relative to Execution Failure**

This chapter reviews existing literature through the analytical lens established in Chapter 1. The purpose of the review is not to evaluate what the literature proves, nor to adjudicate among competing theories, but to clarify how different bodies of work approach institutional failure relative to the problem of execution. The literature is read here as contextual background that illuminates what institutions are commonly understood to be, how they are analyzed, and where prevailing explanations systematically stop short of addressing executional reliability.

Chapter 1 reframed institutional failure as a problem rooted in the unstable execution of institutional facts rather than in corruption control, organizational design, or technological adoption. From this perspective, many familiar explanations appear as partial accounts that operate around the point at which institutional outcomes are actually produced. Economic theories emphasize incentives and enforcement costs; administrative and public management literatures focus on procedures and organizational capacity; digitization and e-government research concentrates on information flow and service delivery; sociotechnical studies describe how human practices and artifacts interact; and algorithmic governance explores formalization and automation. Each of these literatures captures important dimensions of institutional behavior, yet none treats execution itself as a primary analytical object.

Accordingly, this chapter does not attempt a comprehensive survey or enumeration of prior work. Instead, it maps how major strands of literature relate to the execution-centered problem identified earlier. The review is organized to make explicit what each literature explains well, what it presupposes, and what it leaves implicit or unresolved. The objective is not to critique individual authors or to assess empirical adequacy, but to identify structural limits that recur across otherwise diverse approaches.

The review therefore proceeds by contrast and boundary setting rather than synthesis. Literature is examined insofar as it sheds light on institutional rules, discretion, opacity, enforcement, and failure, while remaining silent on the formal execution of status-function assignments. Where relevant, points of convergence and divergence are noted, but no attempt is made to integrate these literatures into a unified theory at this stage. The absence identified is compositional: existing work addresses adjacent aspects of institutional functioning without providing a framework in which execution can be specified, constrained, and reconstructed as a determinate process.

Throughout this chapter, literature is treated as necessary background rather than as constitutive authority. It provides the conceptual and analytical environment in which the dissertation is situated, but it does not supply the solution to the problem under investigation. By making the limits of existing explanations explicit, the chapter establishes the conditions under which a more formal and methodologically grounded approach becomes necessary. This orientation prepares the transition to subsequent chapters without introducing new constructs, proposing institutional designs, or advancing solutions beyond the analytical boundaries already set.
