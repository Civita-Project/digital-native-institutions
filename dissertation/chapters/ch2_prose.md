### **2.0 Chapter Orientation: Literature Relative to Execution Failure**

This chapter reviews existing literature through the analytical lens established in Chapter 1. The purpose of the review is not to evaluate what the literature proves, nor to adjudicate among competing theories, but to clarify how different bodies of work approach institutional failure relative to the problem of execution. The literature is read here as contextual background that illuminates what institutions are commonly understood to be, how they are analyzed, and where prevailing explanations systematically stop short of addressing executional reliability.

Chapter 1 reframed institutional failure as a problem rooted in the unstable execution of institutional facts rather than in corruption control, organizational design, or technological adoption. From this perspective, many familiar explanations appear as partial accounts that operate around the point at which institutional outcomes are actually produced. Economic theories emphasize incentives and enforcement costs; administrative and public management literatures focus on procedures and organizational capacity; digitization and e-government research concentrates on information flow and service delivery; sociotechnical studies describe how human practices and artifacts interact; and algorithmic governance explores formalization and automation. Each of these literatures captures important dimensions of institutional behavior, yet none treats execution itself as a primary analytical object.

Accordingly, this chapter does not attempt a comprehensive survey or enumeration of prior work. Instead, it maps how major strands of literature relate to the execution-centered problem identified earlier. The review is organized to make explicit what each literature explains well, what it presupposes, and what it leaves implicit or unresolved. The objective is not to critique individual authors or to assess empirical adequacy, but to identify structural limits that recur across otherwise diverse approaches.

The review therefore proceeds by contrast and boundary setting rather than synthesis. Literature is examined insofar as it sheds light on institutional rules, discretion, opacity, enforcement, and failure, while remaining silent on the formal execution of status-function assignments. Where relevant, points of convergence and divergence are noted, but no attempt is made to integrate these literatures into a unified theory at this stage. The absence identified is compositional: existing work addresses adjacent aspects of institutional functioning without providing a framework in which execution can be specified, constrained, and reconstructed as a determinate process.

Throughout this chapter, literature is treated as necessary background rather than as constitutive authority. It provides the conceptual and analytical environment in which the dissertation is situated, but it does not supply the solution to the problem under investigation. By making the limits of existing explanations explicit, the chapter establishes the conditions under which a more formal and methodologically grounded approach becomes necessary. This orientation prepares the transition to subsequent chapters without introducing new constructs, proposing institutional designs, or advancing solutions beyond the analytical boundaries already set.


### **2.1 Method of Literature Mapping and Analytical Boundary**

This chapter adopts a selective and boundary-driven method of literature review. Rather than surveying prior work exhaustively or organizing it by discipline, the review is structured around a single analytical question: how existing literature explains institutional performance relative to the point at which institutional outcomes are executed. The purpose of this method is to preserve alignment with the execution-centered problem defined in Chapter 1 while avoiding the dilution that accompanies comprehensive enumeration.

The review is therefore organized by explanatory function rather than by academic field. Literatures are examined according to what they take as their primary object—such as incentives, procedures, technologies, practices, or behavior—and how close their analysis comes to the execution of institutional facts. This approach makes visible a recurring pattern: execution is typically assumed, abstracted away, or treated indirectly, even in accounts that otherwise offer sophisticated explanations of institutional dynamics.

Two analytical boundaries govern the selection and treatment of literature in this chapter. First, inclusion is based on conceptual relevance, not prominence or citation frequency. Works are referenced insofar as they exemplify a class of explanation or a recurring analytical move, not to establish authority or completeness. Second, the review refrains from normative evaluation. The goal is not to judge whether particular theories are correct or incorrect, but to identify what they make observable and what they leave structurally unaddressed.

This mapping strategy treats literature as a set of explanatory lenses rather than as competing solutions. Each lens highlights specific dimensions of institutional behavior while presupposing others. By placing these lenses side by side under a consistent analytical frame, the chapter identifies limits that are not tied to individual authors or schools of thought, but that arise from shared assumptions about where institutional action is located.

Importantly, this method does not seek synthesis or integration at the level of theory. No attempt is made to reconcile economic, administrative, technological, or sociotechnical accounts into a unified model. Such synthesis would presuppose a stable object of integration, which the chapter aims to show is absent with respect to execution. The absence identified is methodological: existing literatures lack a formal treatment of execution as a determinate, auditable process through which institutional facts are produced.

The scope of this chapter is therefore deliberately constrained. It does not introduce new constructs, hierarchies, or mechanisms, nor does it anticipate the framework developed in later chapters. Its contribution lies in clarifying the analytical terrain and in making explicit the boundary conditions under which current explanations operate. By the end of the chapter, the reader should understand not only what the literature explains, but also why the execution-centered problem remains unresolved within it.

### **2.2 Incentive-Based Explanations of Institutional Failure**

A substantial body of institutional and economic literature explains institutional performance through the structure of incentives faced by individual actors and organizations. Within this view, institutional failure arises when incentives are misaligned, enforcement is weak, or monitoring is insufficient, leading rational actors to deviate from prescribed rules. Corruption, rent-seeking, shirking, and noncompliance are treated as predictable responses to incentive environments rather than as anomalies or moral failings.

These accounts provide important insight into why actors exploit discretion when it is available. By modeling behavior as strategic and responsive to payoffs, incentive-based explanations clarify how formal rules can coexist with persistent informal practices and why reforms that alter rewards or penalties can change behavior at the margin. Such work has been influential in shaping policy interventions, emphasizing transparency, accountability mechanisms, and enforcement capacity as levers for institutional improvement.

However, within the execution-centered framing established in Chapter 1, incentive-based explanations operate at a level adjacent to, rather than at, execution itself. They typically assume that institutional rules are already executable and that the production of institutional outcomes is well-defined. The analytical focus is placed on whether actors choose to comply with or deviate from rules, not on whether the rules can be executed in a consistent, determinate manner across cases.

As a result, execution is treated as a background condition. Institutional facts are presumed to be produced reliably, with failure attributed to opportunistic behavior that intervenes after execution has been specified. Even when enforcement costs or information asymmetries are emphasized, the underlying mechanism by which a rule becomes an institutional fact is rarely formalized. Incentives explain behavior within an execution gap, but they do not explain why such gaps persist structurally.

This limitation becomes evident in reform efforts grounded primarily in incentive adjustment. Changes to compensation schemes, penalties, or oversight structures may reduce certain forms of opportunism, yet they often leave the execution process itself unchanged. Where execution remains discretionary or opaque, incentive-based reforms tend to produce localized or temporary improvements rather than durable institutional stability.

Accordingly, this literature is treated here as illuminating a necessary but insufficient dimension of institutional failure. Incentive-based explanations clarify how actors respond to discretion and weak enforcement, but they do not address how discretion arises at the level of execution or how it might be constrained as a matter of institutional design. The persistence of failure under repeated incentive reforms thus points to a deeper analytical gap that cannot be resolved by incentive alignment alone.

### **2.3 Digitization and E-Government Approaches**

A parallel body of literature attributes institutional failure to deficiencies in information processing, administrative capacity, and procedural efficiency, proposing digitization and e-government as corrective measures. Within this perspective, institutions fail because records are fragmented, processes are slow or opaque, and information does not flow reliably across organizational boundaries. Digital systems are expected to reduce discretion, improve transparency, and standardize administrative action by replacing manual procedures with electronic workflows.

This literature has generated extensive analysis of information systems adoption in the public sector, including studies of e-government platforms, digital service delivery, and administrative modernization. Digitization is commonly framed as a means of reducing corruption and inefficiency by increasing traceability, lowering transaction costs, and limiting opportunities for informal intervention. Empirical findings often show improvements in speed, accessibility, and user satisfaction following digital reforms.

Despite these contributions, digitization-focused accounts largely operate at the level of process representation rather than executional determination. Digital systems typically encode existing rules and procedures without formally constraining how institutional facts are produced. Electronic forms, databases, and workflow tools may accelerate administrative activity, but they do not necessarily specify the conditions under which a given input must result in a determinate institutional outcome.

As a result, discretion is frequently relocated rather than eliminated. Where rules are ambiguous or under-specified, digital systems defer judgment to administrators, embed discretionary checkpoints, or rely on manual overrides. In such cases, execution remains contingent on interpretation, even though it is now mediated by digital artifacts. The appearance of modernization can therefore coexist with persistent variability in outcomes across cases and over time.

Moreover, digitization is often evaluated in terms of access, efficiency, or transparency rather than executional reliability. Improvements in information availability do not guarantee that institutional facts are produced consistently, only that deviations may be more visible after the fact. The literature tends to assume that once information systems are in place, execution problems are secondary or derivative, rather than foundational.

Within the analytical frame of this dissertation, digitization and e-government approaches are thus treated as addressing the informational and procedural environment surrounding execution, not execution itself. They clarify how technology can support administrative functions, but they do not resolve how institutional facts are generated in a non-discretionary, reconstructible manner. The persistence of failure in digitally transformed institutions underscores the distinction between representing institutional processes and formally constraining their execution.


### **2.4 Sociotechnical Systems and Institutional Drift**

A further strand of literature explains institutional performance by treating institutions as sociotechnical systems composed of formal rules, technological artifacts, and human practices. From this perspective, institutional outcomes emerge through ongoing interaction between people and systems rather than through the mechanical application of rules alone. Drift, workarounds, and informal practices are understood as adaptive responses to complexity, misfit, or changing conditions within these systems.

Sociotechnical accounts provide valuable descriptive insight into how discretion manifests in practice. They document how administrators interpret rules, how digital systems are adapted to local contexts, and how informal routines develop alongside formal procedures. Such analyses help explain why institutional behavior often diverges from formal design, even when rules are clear and technologies are in place. Drift is framed as a product of situated action, organizational learning, and the practical negotiation of constraints.

However, within the execution-centered framing of this dissertation, sociotechnical explanations locate variability at the level of interaction rather than at the level of executional specification. They describe how discretion is exercised and amplified through human–artifact relations, but they do not explain why execution remains open to discretion in the first place. The presence of informal practices presupposes an execution environment in which outcomes are not fully determined by formal rules.

As a result, sociotechnical analyses tend to treat executional indeterminacy as an empirical given rather than as an analytical problem. Drift is observed, categorized, and sometimes managed through training, redesign, or cultural alignment, yet the underlying execution process remains under-specified. Institutional coherence is sought through better coordination between social and technical elements, not through formal constraints on how institutional facts are produced.

This focus has important implications for reform. Efforts grounded in sociotechnical alignment may reduce friction or improve usability, but they cannot eliminate discretionary execution where rules themselves do not determine outcomes. Drift may be mitigated temporarily, but it remains structurally possible as long as execution depends on interpretation at the point of action.

Accordingly, sociotechnical systems literature is treated here as clarifying the manifestation of institutional drift rather than its structural origin. It explains how discretionary execution unfolds and stabilizes in practice, but it does not provide mechanisms for executional reliability. Within the analytical boundary set in Chapter 1, the persistence of drift under sociotechnical reforms reinforces the distinction between describing institutional behavior and constraining the execution through which institutional facts are generated.
