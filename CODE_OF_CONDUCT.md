# **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**

### *Code of Conduct for the Digital Native Institutions Repository*

**Academic Integrity • Conceptual Rigor • Respect for Theoretical Boundaries**

---

## **1. Purpose**

This repository contains the formal academic theory, methodological framework, and dissertation materials for:

* **Digital Native Institutions (DNI)**
* **National Service Unit (NSU)**
* associated institutional models and evaluation tools

The goal is to maintain:

* conceptual stability
* methodological rigor
* verifiable academic integrity
* respectful, structured collaboration

All contributors must follow this Code of Conduct.

---

## **2. Core Principles**

### **A. Respect for Theoretical Boundaries**

The theory files in `/theory/` are **frozen** and represent academically grounded definitions.
Contributors must not:

* redefine canonical terms
* introduce conceptual drift
* alter institutional primitives
* contradict the frozen architecture

Unless explicitly authorized.

---

### **B. Intellectual Honesty**

Contributors must:

* make claims only when supported by theory or evidence
* clearly mark uncertainties or hypotheses
* avoid overstating conclusions
* maintain traceability of sources and reasoning

No ungrounded assertions.

---

### **C. Methodological Discipline**

All contributions must adhere to the methodological stack:

* Searlean institutional analysis
* Design Science Research (DSR)
* Institutional economics (CME)
* Science and Technology Studies (STS)
* Counterfactual falsifiability
* Failure Canon comparative analysis

Deviation from methodology must be justified explicitly.

---

## **3. Conduct Expectations**

### **A. Clarity and Precision**

Contributors must:

* write clearly and concisely
* avoid ambiguous terminology
* use MECE structuring when relevant
* maintain explicit definition boundaries

Precision is mandatory.

---

### **B. Professional and Respectful Interaction**

Academic disagreement is welcome.
However:

* critiques must be framed in terms of logic and evidence
* personal comments, assumptions, or tone-based critiques are prohibited
* engagement must remain constructive

No ad hominem or emotional argumentation.

---

### **C. No Misrepresentation**

Contributors must not:

* misrepresent theory
* misquote definitions
* attribute claims incorrectly
* conceal methodological weaknesses

Transparency is required.

---

### **D. Respect for SR0 Review Process**

SR0 enforces purity, correctness, and methodological consistency.

Contributors must not:

* attempt to circumvent SR0 enforcement
* pressure for acceptance of impure or contradictory contributions
* introduce definitions indirectly through drafts or diagrams

All contributions must pass purity checks.

---

## **4. Prohibited Behaviors**

* introducing conceptual drift
* redefining institutional primitives
* posting unverifiable claims
* providing political, ideological, or emotional arguments
* contributing identifiable personal data to `/field-data/`
* using the repo for non-academic purposes

Violations may result in rejection of contributions or removal of collaborator privileges.

---

## **5. Responsibility to the Academic Record**

This repository is part of a formal PhD dissertation.
Contributors share responsibility for ensuring:

* accuracy
* traceability
* reproducibility
* falsifiability
* integrity of the intellectual architecture

All contributions become part of a public, permanent academic archive.

---

## **6. Reporting Issues**

If collaborators notice:

* theoretical inconsistencies
* methodological errors
* purity violations
* unsafe contributions

They should open an issue titled:

```
[THEORY-ALERT]: <description>
```

Or contact the project maintainer directly.

---

## **7. Enforcement**

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed through:

* discussion and clarification
* revision requests
* contribution blocking
* in severe cases, removal of collaboration access

SR0 may also flag violations through purity or recursion warnings.

---

## **8. Acknowledgment**

By contributing to this repository, you agree to:

* respect the frozen theory
* maintain conceptual and methodological rigor
* collaborate constructively and professionally
* uphold academic integrity
* follow the SR0 evaluation process
