### *Digital-Native Methodology (DNM) — v1.1*
### *Substrate-Native Evidence Methodology for DNI Systems*

---

## Epistemic Status (Non-Negotiable)

Digital-Native Methodology (DNM) defines **how evidence is produced, represented,
and exposed** in research concerning **Digital Native Institutions (DNI)**.

DNM is:

- **methodological**, not ontological
- **downstream of theory**, not theory-generating
- **execution-dependent**, not execution-defining

DNM does **not**:
- define institutions,
- define status functions,
- define DNI conditions,
- define SFEU architecture,
- validate truth.

DNM governs **evidence handling only**.

If any part of this file conflicts with Substrate-0′ artifacts,
this file is invalid.

Artifact instantiation constrained by declared technology stack


---

## Dependency Order (Explicit)

DNM is strictly subordinate to:

1. `ontology.md`
2. `dni_theory.md`
3. `dni_blueprint.md`
4. `sfeu_blueprint.md`
5. `sfeu_prototype.md`
6. `corruption_equilibrium.md`
7. `counterfactuals.md`
8. `failure_case_canon.md`
9. `substrate0_prime_purity_test.md`

DNM **cannot introduce constraints upstream** of this list.

---

## 0. Purpose

DNM answers one question only:

> **Given a DNI executed via SFEU,  
> how must evidence be generated so that institutional claims are falsifiable,
> reconstructible, and independently verifiable?**

DNM replaces paper-era research methods **only where**:
- institutional state transitions are protocol-executed,
- evidence is natively digital,
- audit reconstruction is possible.

DNM does **not** apply outside DNI-eligible domains.

---

## 1. Formal Definition

> **Digital-Native Methodology (DNM)** is an evidence methodology in which
> all empirical claims are grounded in **protocol-executed institutional traces**,
> such that:
>
> - evidence is identity-attributed or explicitly identity-neutral,
> - lineage is immutable and reconstructible,
> - interpretation is not required to establish institutional meaning,
> - counterfactual discrimination is possible.

DNM is a **substrate-compatible epistemic mode**, not a research style.

---

## 2. Methodological Axioms (Non-Derivable)

### **Axiom 1 — Status-Function Preservation**

Evidence must preserve the distinction between:

- brute facts (X),
- institutional facts (Y),
- context (C).

No evidence may collapse X, Y, or C.

**Anchor:** `ontology.md`

---

### **Axiom 2 — Execution-First Evidence**

Only events that pass through **SFEU-executed state transitions**
may be treated as institutional evidence.

Narrative summaries are **not evidence**.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Identity Binding or Explicit Neutrality**

Each datum must be either:

- cryptographically identity-bound, or
- explicitly identity-neutral with justification.

Implicit identity is forbidden.

---

### **Axiom 4 — Attestation Lineage Completeness**

Every datum must expose:

- origin,
- attester class,
- timestamp,
- signature or integrity proof,
- rule-context snapshot.

If lineage cannot be reconstructed → evidence invalid.

---

### **Axiom 5 — Counterfactual Discriminability**

Every evidence class must support placement into:

- observed world,
- permissible alternative world,
- prohibited world,
- failure signature class.

If not discriminable → not admissible.

---

### **Axiom 6 — Deterministic Interpretability**

Institutional meaning must be reconstructible using:

- rule versions,
- evidence,
- attestations,
- execution traces.

No researcher interpretation allowed.

---

### **Axiom 7 — Drift & CME Detectability**

Evidence must expose:
- corruption migration signals,
- exception pressure,
- drift patterns aligned with CME.

Opaque evidence is methodologically invalid.

---

## 3. Evidence Representations (SFEU-Compatible Only)

All DNM evidence must be representable using **SFEU primitives**:

- identity bindings (MVLP scope),
- document & evidence lineage graphs,
- attestation DAGs,
- deterministic state-transition logs,
- explicit exception emissions.

Evidence requiring:
- semantic inference,
- AI judgment,
- probabilistic interpretation,
- hidden discretion

→ **invalid under DNM**.

---

## 4. Evidence Classes Supported

### **4.1 Institutional Execution Evidence**
- protocol conformance rates
- transition success/failure
- exception routing frequency

### **4.2 Attestation Evidence**
- attestation conflicts
- revocation events
- liability concentration

### **4.3 Latency & Variance Evidence**
- median latency
- tail behavior
- variance tightening or explosion

### **4.4 Drift & Corruption Signals**
- off-protocol attempt signatures
- exception inflation
- governance pressure indicators

### **4.5 Meta-Evidence**
- rule version churn
- failure-canon alignment
- counterfactual mismatches

---

## 5. Role of DNM in the Dissertation

DNM supplies the **evidence substrate** for:

- DNI falsification,
- CME testing,
- counterfactual discrimination,
- failure-canon validation,
- DSR artifact grounding.

DNM does **not**:
- justify desirability,
- argue policy,
- infer ethics,
- replace theory.

---

## 6. Relationship to Counterfactuals

Counterfactuals define **what would differ**.  
DNM defines **how such differences are observed**.

Without DNM-compliant evidence:
- counterfactual claims are invalid,
- falsification collapses.

---

## 7. Methodological Falsifiers

DNM is invalid if:

1. Evidence cannot be mapped to SFEU traces.
2. Institutional meaning requires researcher narration.
3. Lineage or execution context is missing.
4. Counterfactual placement is impossible.
5. CME signals cannot be observed.
6. Readers cannot independently reconstruct outcomes.

Any violation → **methodological impurity**.

---

## 8. Boundary Conditions

DNM applies **only** to:

- DNI-eligible administrative domains,
- protocol-executed institutions,
- evidence-native workflows.

DNM does **not** apply to:
- adjudication,
- moral reasoning,
- political judgment,
- informal institutions.

Applying DNM outside these bounds is a category error.

---

## 9. Status

**Frozen (v1.1).**

This file may change only if:
- `ontology.md` changes, or
- `dni_theory.md` revises falsification logic, or
- SFEU execution invariants change.
