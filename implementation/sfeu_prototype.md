### *Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU): Design Science Research Prototype (v2.0)*

---

# **SFEU Prototype**

### *Executable Artifact for Digital Native Institutions*

**Version 2.0 — DSR-Bound · Execution-Pure · CME-Observable**

---

## **0. Epistemic Status**

This file specifies the **SFEU prototype** as a **Design Science Research (DSR) artifact**.

It is **not**:

* a conceptual illustration,
* a reference architecture,
* or a policy proposal.

It **is**:

> a *working, falsifiable execution artifact* built to test whether
> **Digital Native Institution (DNI) theory holds under real institutional stress**.

All claims made by this prototype must be **observable, reproducible, and falsifiable**.

This prototype functions as an empirical falsification artifact for Computable Institutions (CI), by testing whether DNI theory, when enforced by SFEU execution, satisfies CI computability criteria under adversarial conditions.

---

## **1. DSR Framing (Explicit)**

This prototype conforms to **Design Science Research** along the following dimensions:

### **1.1 Problem Relevance**

Administrative institutions suffer from:

* discretionary execution,
* unverifiable state transitions,
* corruption opacity,
* audit reconstruction failure.

These failures are **institutional**, not UX or optimization problems.

---

### **1.2 Artifact Definition**

The artifact is the **SFEU prototype**, defined as:

> A minimal execution system capable of enforcing at least one real
> **X → Y-in-C** institutional transition with:
>
> * deterministic execution,
> * explicit failure,
> * immutable attestation,
> * CME-observable side effects.

---

### **1.3 Design Knowledge Contribution**

The prototype contributes **design knowledge**, not features:

* Demonstrates that **status-function execution can be protocol-bound**
* Shows **where corruption migrates** when discretion collapses
* Validates the **execution–institution separation**

---

### **1.4 Evaluation Rigor**

Evaluation is based on:

* execution traces,
* exception patterns,
* audit reconstruction,
* corruption migration signals,

—not stakeholder satisfaction or efficiency metrics.

---

### **1.5 Research Rigor**

The prototype is constrained by:

* `ontology.md`
* `dni_theory.md`
* `dni_blueprint.md`
* `sfeu_blueprint.md`
* `corruption_equilibrium.md`
* `computable_institutions_tech_stack.md`

Any behavior violating these files **invalidates** the artifact.

---

## **2. Scope of the Prototype (Deliberately Narrow)**

The SFEU prototype:

* executes **exactly one** institutional use-case initially
* prioritizes **correctness over coverage**
* is intentionally hostile to silent success

This is a **research probe**, not a platform.

---

## **3. Prototype Use-Case Definition**

A valid prototype must specify:

* **X** — concrete digital evidence (e.g. signed document)
* **Y** — institutional status change (e.g. registration state)
* **C** — explicit rule-set version

The mapping must be:

* real (not hypothetical),
* jurisdiction-anchored,
* time-bound.

---

## **4. Execution Architecture (Prototype-Level)**

The prototype instantiates **only the minimum required SFEU modules**:

1. Identity Verification
2. Evidence & Document Integrity
3. Context Resolution
4. Status-Function Execution
5. Exception Routing
6. Audit & Attestation Ledger

No additional logic is permitted.

---

## **5. Explicit Non-Goals (DSR Discipline)**

The prototype **must not** attempt to:

* optimize latency or UX
* generalize across institutions
* resolve ambiguity
* embed AI judgment
* simulate governance outcomes

Any such addition contaminates DSR validity.

---

## **6. CME Observability Requirements**

The prototype must expose **corruption migration signals**, including:

* where discretionary pressure accumulates,
* which attestations are contested,
* which exceptions recur,
* which actors attempt off-protocol action.

If corruption appears to “disappear,” the prototype is **invalid**.

---

## **7. Failure Modes (Required, Not Exceptional)**

A correct prototype is expected to:

* fail frequently,
* emit explicit exceptions,
* surface institutional friction.

A prototype that “mostly works” is **suspect**.

---

## **8. Evaluation Metrics (DSR-Aligned)**

The prototype is evaluated by:

* % of protocol-valid executions
* exception frequency & clustering
* audit reconstruction success
* CME-consistent migration patterns
* reproducibility across runs

Performance metrics are **out of scope**.

---

## **9. Relation to Dissertation**

This prototype grounds:

* Chapter 3 (Methodology — DSR)
* Chapter 4 (Artifact & Evaluation)
* CME validation
* Failure Case Canon

It is **not** illustrative; it is **evidentiary**.

---

## **10. Status**

This file is **frozen** unless:

* DSR criteria change,
* CME predictions are falsified,
* or execution violates Substrate-0′ constraints.
