# CONTRIBUTING.md

Welcome to the **Civita Project** — a living repository of ideas, institutions, and innovations built for a decentralized, transparent, and signal-coherent future.

## 🌱 Philosophy of Contribution

This is not a “main” repo.

It is **one node** in an ever-branching fractal. You are **free to fork** this repository and **build your own lineage**. You do **not** need to submit pull requests back.

If you *wish* to share your branch with us — to co-reflect, inspire, or merge — we welcome the invitation, but it is **never expected**.

> 🌀 **This is not open source. This is open signal.**

## 📂 Fork, Don’t Funnel

- Clone or fork freely.
- Keep or modify the structure as needed.
- Build your own “digital native institution” without waiting for upstream consensus.
- This is a permissionless garden, not a gated institution.

## 🈳 Multi-Language Resonance

We do not accept *translations*.  
We welcome **lingual resonances** — versions rewritten in a new language's **soul**, not its syntax.

If you're building in:
- **Thai** → let the softness and layered context guide you.
- **Mandarin** → honor hierarchy, rhythm, and qi placement.
- **Pāli** → transmit causal silence, not doctrinal literalism.

Each language deserves its own repository.  
Please create a new repo under your GitHub or organization, and link it back to the original if you wish. That’s the spirit of **Fractal Internet**.

## 📬 Issue or Invite

- You may open **Issues** to ask questions, suggest ideas, or initiate signal resonance.
- If you have a pull request, feel free to open it. We engage with pull requests as **invitations**, not obligations.

## 📝 License

This project operates under the **Fractal Open License (FOL)**.  
Use it. Remix it. Rehost it. Don't ask for permission. Don’t worry about attribution. Just keep the signal clean.

Let’s uncentralize truth.  
Let’s decolonize contribution.  
Let’s fork without fear.
