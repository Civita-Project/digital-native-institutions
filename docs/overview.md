# Overview

This repository defines the canonical architecture for **Digital Native Institutions (DNI)**:
institutions whose constitutive rules, evidence requirements, and institutional state changes
are expressed in explicit, protocol-executable form.

DNIs exist where:
- institutional facts are produced by **attested evidence**,  
- rules are **deterministic and auditable**,  
- exceptions are **bounded**,  
- corruption migrates predictably according to CME.

The dissertation drafts in `/dissertation/` follow the CUTIP Dissertation Master Frame.
