# Award Ruler Construction Guide
## Version 1.1 — Presentation-Layer Only (Non-Authoritative)

---

## Epistemic Status (Hard Constraint)

This file defines **how to construct a presentation-layer “award ruler”**
from **already-extracted descriptive patterns**.

It is **explicitly non-authoritative**.

This file:

- does NOT define ontology
- does NOT define theory
- does NOT validate DNI
- does NOT evaluate SFEU
- does NOT participate in falsification
- does NOT introduce institutional meaning

If this file is used to influence:
- Substrate-0′ ontology
- DNI necessary or sufficient conditions
- SFEU architecture or execution
- CME claims
- counterfactual logic

→ **INVALID under Substrate-0′ Purity Test (Test 8)**.

---

## Dependency Order (Non-Negotiable)

This file is strictly subordinate to:

1. `substrate0_prime_purity_test.md`
2. `ontology.md`
3. `dni_theory.md`
4. `dni_blueprint.md`
5. `sfeu_blueprint.md`
6. `sfeu_prototype.md`
7. `corruption_equilibrium.md`
8. `counterfactuals.md`
9. `failure_case_canon.md`
10. `award_extraction_outline_v2.2.md`
11. `award_pattern_extraction_framework.md`
12. `evp_v2.md`

If a ruler conflicts with any upstream file, the ruler is discarded.

## Purpose

An **award ruler** is a *presentation artifact* that:

> Translates extracted descriptive award patterns  
> into a **readable narrative alignment tool**  
> for external evaluators.

It exists solely to help answer:

> “How would an external evaluator likely *describe* this work,
> using their own retrospective language patterns?”

It does **not** answer:
- “Is this correct?”
- “Is this valid?”
- “Is this true?”

Those questions are settled **only** by falsification and execution.

---

## What an Award Ruler Is

An award ruler is:

- a **mapping layer**
- a **descriptive lens**
- a **narrative scaffold**
- a **communication aid**

It is used **after** the work already satisfies:
- Substrate-0′ purity
- DNI theory requirements
- SFEU execution constraints
- CME consistency
- counterfactual rigor

---

## What an Award Ruler Is NOT

An award ruler must never be used to:

- derive criteria of correctness
- select architectures
- justify ontology
- weaken falsification
- override counterfactual failures
- claim institutional legitimacy
- imply inevitability or superiority

Awards describe recognition.
They do not create institutions.

---

## Construction Inputs (Strict)

An award ruler may use **only**:

- descriptive pattern outputs from  
  `award_pattern_extraction_framework.md`
- narrative constraints from  
  `award_extraction_outline_v2.2.md`
- presentation constraints from  
  `presentation_layer_guide.md`

No other inputs are permitted.

---

## Ruler Construction Steps (MECE)

### Step 1 — Select Descriptive Pattern Classes

Choose relevant pattern classes (descriptive only), e.g.:

- mechanism_patterns
- ontology_patterns
- predictive_patterns
- counterfactual_patterns
- contrast_patterns
- empirical_patterns

Selection does NOT imply importance.

---

### Step 2 — Map Patterns to Narrative Slots

Patterns may be mapped only to:

- abstract wording
- framing emphasis
- ordering of exposition
- evaluator-facing language choices

They must NOT be mapped to:
- claims of validity
- necessity
- sufficiency
- institutional truth

---

### Step 3 — Enforce Ontology Firewall

Before finalizing a ruler, explicitly verify:

- No new entities introduced
- No new mechanisms implied
- No reinterpretation of X, Y, or C
- No execution claims made

Failure → discard ruler.

---

### Step 4 — Bind to EVP (Presentation Only)

If used, the ruler may inform **EVP v2.0** sections that are:

- explicitly marked as presentation-layer
- explicitly non-authoritative
- explicitly downstream of falsification

EVP remains subordinate to Substrate-0′ constraints.

---

## Prohibited Ruler Behaviors

The following are strictly forbidden:

- “Reverse-engineering” institutions from awards
- Treating award language as necessary conditions
- Using rulers to argue inevitability
- Using rulers to mask empirical weakness
- Using rulers to preempt falsification
- Using rulers to shape theory or execution

Any such use → **FAIL (Test 8)**.

---

## Validation Rule

An award ruler is valid **iff**:

- it passes Substrate-0′ Purity Test (Test 8),
- it introduces zero upstream influence,
- it operates only at presentation layer,
- it can be deleted without affecting any theory or artifact.

If deletion changes meaning → the ruler is invalid.

---

## Status

**Frozen (v1.1).**

This file may change only if:
- the Substrate-0′ Purity Test changes, or
- award-based presentation is abandoned entirely.
