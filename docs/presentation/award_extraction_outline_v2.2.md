### *Version 2.2 — Presentation-Layer Pattern Extraction (Non-Authoritative)*

---

## Epistemic Status (Non-Negotiable)

This file defines a **presentation-layer pattern extraction outline** for analyzing
how external evaluators (awards, prizes, institutional recognitions) *describe* work
that is later considered significant.

It is **explicitly non-authoritative**.

This file:
- does **not** define ontology,
- does **not** define theory,
- does **not** validate DNI,
- does **not** influence SFEU design,
- does **not** participate in falsification.

All extracted patterns are **downstream descriptions only**.

If this file conflicts with any Substrate-0′ artifact, it is automatically invalid.

---

## Dependency Order (Explicit)

This outline depends on — and is subordinate to — the following files:

1. `ontology.md`
2. `dni_theory.md`
3. `dni_blueprint.md`
4. `sfeu_blueprint.md`
5. `sfeu_prototype.md`
6. `corruption_equilibrium.md`
7. `counterfactuals.md`
8. `failure_case_canon.md`
9. `substrate0_prime_purity_test.md`

This file **cannot introduce constraints upstream** of this list.

---

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this outline is to answer:

> *When external evaluators retrospectively recognize work as significant,  
> what recurring descriptive patterns appear in their language?*

This is a **descriptive extraction**, not a normative filter.

---

## What This File Is NOT

This file must not be used to:
- justify correctness,
- argue rigor,
- shape institutional architecture,
- modify DNI conditions,
- influence SFEU execution logic,
- override counterfactual falsification,
- replace empirical validation.

Awards do **not** validate institutions.  
They describe perceived impact *after the fact*.

---

## Pattern Extraction Scope

Extraction is limited to **linguistic and structural descriptors**, such as:

- problem framing language
- novelty claims
- scope articulation
- cross-domain references
- mechanism emphasis
- implementation independence
- failure acknowledgement

No pattern may introduce:
- new entities,
- new mechanisms,
- new ontological commitments.

---

## Extraction Dimensions (MECE, Descriptive Only)

### D1 — Problem Framing
How evaluators describe:
- the *class* of problem addressed
- its perceived irreducibility
- prior failure context

### D2 — Mechanism Visibility
Whether the work is described as:
- mechanism-explicit
- principle-driven
- implementation-independent

(No claim is made about correctness.)

---

### D3 — Constraint Handling
How limitations, trade-offs, and failures are discussed:
- explicitly acknowledged
- implicitly ignored
- reframed as scope boundaries

---

### D4 — Generality Claims
Language used to describe:
- transferability
- extensibility
- boundary awareness

---

### D5 — Institutional Interaction
How institutions are referenced:
- as context
- as obstacle
- as consequence

(No institutional authority is inferred.)

---

## Prohibited Extractions

The following are **explicitly forbidden**:

- extracting “validity” criteria
- deriving ontological claims
- inferring necessary conditions
- reverse-engineering institutions
- projecting evaluator intent upstream

Violation → **FAIL under Substrate-0′ Purity Test (Test 8)**.

---

## Relationship to EVP v2

This outline may **inform narrative framing** within `evp_v2.md` **only**.

Constraints:
- EVP must remain presentation-only.
- EVP may not back-propagate patterns into theory.
- EVP is subordinate to falsification, not a substitute for it.

---

## Relationship to Meta-Ruler (If Present)

If `meta_ruler.md` exists:
- This outline provides *raw descriptive inputs only*.
- It does not shape or constrain the Meta-Ruler.
- It does not define evaluation standards.

Meta-Ruler (if any) must pass the Substrate-0′ Purity Test independently.

---

## Validation Rule

Any use of extracted patterns must satisfy:

- Substrate-0′ purity
- DNI theory falsifiability
- CME consistency
- Counterfactual discriminability

If not, extracted patterns are discarded.

---

## Status

**Frozen (v2.2).**

This file may change only if:
- the Substrate-0′ Purity Test changes, or
- the project explicitly abandons presentation-layer separation.
