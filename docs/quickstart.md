# Quickstart Guide

If you have **five minutes**, follow this sequence:

## 1. Understand the Foundations
Read:
- `/theory/ontology.md`  
- `/theory/dni_theory.md`

These establish:
- What an institution *is* (status-function ontology)
- What qualifies as a Digital Native Institution (formal definition)

## 2. Understand the Execution Layer
Read:
- `/theory/nsu_blueprint.md`
- `/theory/nsu_prototype.md`

These define:
- The National Service Unit (NSU)
- The four primitives: identity, lineage, attestation, state-transition

## 3. Understand the Predictive Model
Read:
- `/theory/corruption_equilibrium.md`
- `/theory/counterfactuals.md`

These files explain:
- How corruption migrates under protocol constraints
- What patterns would falsify or confirm the theory

## 4. Explore the Dissertation
Draft chapters live in `/dissertation/`, each following the CUTIP Master Frame.
