# **Digital Native Institution (DNI) Blueprint**

### *Constitutive Institutional Form → Executable Architecture Mapping*

**Version 2.0 — Ontology-Constrained · SFEU-Executed · CME-Aligned**

---

## **0. Epistemic Status**

This file defines **how DNI theory is realized architecturally**.

It does **not** introduce new institutional meaning, policy intent, or governance authority.
It **maps** the **constitutive conditions of a DNI** (from `dni_theory.md`) onto:

* execution boundaries,
* architectural components,
* observable system surfaces.

This blueprint operates at **Substrate-1 (institutional realization)** and is invalid if it contradicts:

* `ontology.md`
* `dni_theory.md`
* `computable_institutions_tech_stack.md`

This blueprint specifies how Digital Native Institutions (DNI)—a realizable subclass of Computable Institutions (CI)—are instantiated architecturally without redefining institutional meaning.

## **1. Position in the System**

| Layer             | Role                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ontology**      | Defines what an institutional fact *is*                |
| **DNI Theory**    | Defines what qualifies as a Digital Native Institution |
| **DNI Blueprint** | Maps theory → architecture                             |
| **SFEU**          | Executes status-function transitions                   |
| **CME**           | Predicts corruption relocation under execution         |

This file is the **bridge** between theory and execution.

---

## **2. DNI vs SFEU (Hard Separation)**

**DNI**
= *Institutional form*
= rules, status-functions, and constitutive conditions

**SFEU**
= *Execution machinery*
= deterministic enforcement of X → Y-in-C

> **Rule:**
> DNI defines *what must be true*.
> SFEU enforces *what is executed*.
> No architectural component may collapse these roles.

---

## **3. Mapping DNI Necessary Conditions → Architecture**

### **N1. Identity Binding**

**Theory requirement**
Cryptographically verifiable identity with non-repudiation.

**Architectural realization**

* Digital Identity Layer (see tech stack Layer 1)
* Bound to SFEU Identity Verification Module

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* Identity does not grant status
* Identity does not infer intent

---

### **N2. Document & Evidence Integrity**

**Theory requirement**
Immutable, verifiable institutional evidence.

**Architectural realization**

* Digital Documents & Evidence Layer (Layer 2)
* Hash-based integrity, signature provenance
* Lineage stored in audit ledger

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* No semantic interpretation
* No legal sufficiency judgment

---

### **N3. Programmable Settlement**

**Theory requirement**
Obligations and outcomes must be machine-verifiable.

**Architectural realization**

* Settlement & Obligation Layer (Layer 7)
* Triggered *only* by successful SFEU execution

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* No redistribution logic
* No policy optimization

---

### **N4. Protocol-Governed Transitions**

**Theory requirement**
Administrative actions executed deterministically.

**Architectural realization**

* Rule Representation Layer (Layer 3)
* Context Binding Layer (Layer 4)
* SFEU Core Execution (Layer 5)

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* No discretion
* No ambiguity resolution

---

### **N5. Auditability**

**Theory requirement**
All transitions reconstructible end-to-end.

**Architectural realization**

* Audit & Attestation Ledger (Layer 8)
* Cryptographic, append-only records

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* No narrative summarization
* No outcome judgment

---

### **N6. Declared Exception Pathways**

**Theory requirement**
Explicit handling when X fails to count as Y-in-C.

**Architectural realization**

* Exception Routing Layer (Layer 6)
* Structured failure signals
* Governance handoff *outside protocol*

**Explicit non-capabilities**

* No silent override
* No exception resolution inside execution

---

## **4. DNI Sufficiency Conditions (Architectural Interpretation)**

### **S1 — Fully Protocol-Constrained DNI**

Architectural signature:

* All administrative transitions executed by SFEU
* Zero discretionary execution surfaces
* Exceptions always explicit and externalized

### **S2 — Partial Human Judgment DNI**

Architectural signature:

* Human judgment exists *only before* execution
* All attestations, workflows, and settlements remain protocol-bound
* No discretionary bypass after submission

---

## **5. Observable System Surfaces**

A valid DNI must expose **measurable surfaces**:

* Protocol conformance ratio
* Exception frequency & routing patterns
* Attestation dispute rates
* Settlement execution traces
* Audit reconstruction success

These surfaces are required for:

* CME measurement
* falsification
* Failure Canon comparison

---

## **6. DNI ↔ CME Coupling**

The DNI blueprint is **CME-load-bearing**.

Only when:

* DNI necessary conditions hold, **and**
* execution is enforced by SFEU,

does **Corruption Migration Equilibrium** become defined and observable.

Any architecture claiming DNI without CME observability is **incoherent**.

---

## **7. What This Blueprint Explicitly Forbids**

A system claiming DNI **must not**:

* embed interpretation inside execution
* allow silent exception handling
* collapse rule definition and execution
* treat corruption as eliminable rather than migratory
* rely on AI to generate institutional facts

Violation of any prohibition invalidates the DNI claim.

---

## **8. Relationship to Prototype**

The **SFEU prototype** is a **minimal instantiation** of this blueprint.

Prototype success criteria:

* at least one real X → Y-in-C mapping
* explicit exception emission
* full audit reconstruction
* CME-consistent corruption relocation signals

Anything less is **not** a DNI instantiation.

---

## **9. Status**

This blueprint is **frozen** unless:

* DNI theory changes at Substrate-0′, or
* empirical falsification contradicts CME under enforced SFEU execution.
