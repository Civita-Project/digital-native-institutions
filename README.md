# **Computable Institutions**

**Canonical repository for the ontology, theory, execution architecture, and dissertation framework of Computable Institutions.**

This repository formalizes how **institutional facts** can be made *computable* **without collapsing law, meaning, or governance into software**.

It is simultaneously:

* a **frozen theoretical substrate**,
* an **execution-constrained architectural reference**,
* and a **CUTIP PhD dissertation backbone**.

## **What Are Computable Institutions?**

**Computable Institutions** are institutions whose:

* constitutive rules,
* evidence models,
* execution constraints,
* and failure modes

are represented in **explicit, protocol-executable form**, such that:

* institutional facts are produced deterministically,
* administrative discretion is structurally constrained,
* corruption **relocates** into observable and contestable zones,
* failures surface explicitly instead of being absorbed silently.

This project does **not** claim to eliminate:

* corruption,
* ambiguity,
* human judgment,
* or political conflict.

It makes them **measurable, auditable, and governable**.

## **Core Distinction (Non-Negotiable)**

### **Digital Native Institutions (DNI)**

* Define the **institutional form**
* Specify **status-function mappings**
  (`X counts as Y in context C`)
* Operate at the level of **constitutive rules**
* Answer: *What does it mean for an institution to exist digitally?*

See:

* `ontology.md`
* `dni_theory.md`
* `dni_blueprint.md`

---

### **Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)**

* Pure **execution machinery**
* Enforces institutional rules **without interpretation**
* Cannot legislate, judge, infer intent, or optimize outcomes
* Emits **explicit failure only**

Answer: *How are institutional facts executed and attested without discretion?*

See:

* `sfeu_blueprint.md`
* `sfeu_prototype.md`

> **Institutions define meaning.
> Execution enforces rules.
> These must never be conflated.**

## **Why “Computable Institutions”? (Naming Resolution)**

* **Computable Institutions** — umbrella concept (this repository)
* **DNI** — institutional *type* (ontology + theory)
* **SFEU** — execution *substrate* (architecture + prototype)

The term **Computable Institutions** emerged after DNI because:

* it names the **combined achievement**:
  institutional facts that can be *executed, audited, and falsified*,
* without implying:
  digital government,
  blockchain governance,
  or automation of meaning.

DNI is **not obsolete**.
It is a **necessary component** of Computable Institutions.

## **Canonical Execution Axioms (Frozen)**

All artifacts in this repository are bound by hard execution axioms defined in:

* `institutional_execution_axioms.md`

Including (summary):

* Institution ≠ execution
* Corruption is **conserved**, not reduced
* No interpretive execution
* Explicit failure only
* Observability as a design requirement
* Worst-case (Thailand-class) validation

Any artifact violating these axioms is **invalid**, regardless of elegance.

---

## **Canonical Stack: Computable Institutions**

The minimal MECE institutional–technical stack is defined in:

* `computable_institutions_stack.md`

It spans:

* digital identity, documents, and obligations
* constitutive legal rules
* deterministic rule representation
* SFEU execution
* attestation and audit surfaces
* open transmission (email-class)
* content-addressed storage
* cryptographic integrity
* **non-binding AI interpretation only**

## **Methodology**

This work uses **Digital-Native Methodology (DNM)**:

* execution-first
* falsification-forward
* adversarially validated
* architecture-bound

Narrative coherence is *never* treated as evidence.

---

## **Validation Stance**

Thailand is treated as a **worst-case institutional environment**:

* high discretion
* norm-driven governance
* corruption-tolerant equilibria

If a construct survives Thailand-class conditions, it generalizes.
If not, it is rejected.

---

## **Status**

This repository is:

* ontology-bound
* execution-constrained
* falsifiable by design

Academic prose, diagrams, and examples are **presentation layers only**.
They do not generate truth.
