# Civita Project – Digital Native Institutions (DNI)

**“Institutions today are slow, opaque, and brittle. Digital Native Institutions flip that.”**

Welcome to the open-source dissertation and system lab for _Digital Native Institutions_ (DNI), the backbone of the **Civita Project**.

This repository is not just a thesis. It is:
- A living **blueprint** for re-architecting how institutions operate.
- A full-stack, multilingual, real-world transformation playbook.
- A forkable, inspectable, collaborative vessel for truth.

## 🌍 What You’ll Find Here

- **Plain-language theory** rooted in lived systems.
- **Field-validated patterns**, not lab-bounded prototypes.
- A **recursive co-creation** between human and AI.
- Support for **English, Thai, and Mandarin** (in progress).
- A foundation for others to **fork, remix, and reapply** to their own context.

## 📁 Repo Structure

Each `.md` file corresponds to a building block of the framework. Begin with:
- `00_Preface.md`
- `01_Table_of_Contents.md`
- Then proceed numerically or use this README to navigate.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

DNI is not just a new model. It is a reframe:
- From _documents_ → to _data_
- From _control_ → to _resonance_
- From _opacity_ → to _radical transparency_

This project is a stake in the ground for institutions that **flow**, **learn**, and **adapt**—powered by real humans, real code, and real transformation.
