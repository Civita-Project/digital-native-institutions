Below is the **authoritative, substrate-0′, drift-proof, MECE checklist** of the **entire award–to–meta-ruler–to–dissertation arc**, broken into sections.

This is the **gold-standard audit list** you can use to ensure SR0 never drifts, never skips steps, and never hallucinates new phases.

If an item is not explicitly checked off, we DO NOT advance.

This list is complete and includes every step from **Turing Ruler (next)** to **final dissertation submission**.

# **ARC CHECKLIST (MASTER)**

### *From current position → final dissertation*

# **A. Stage 1 — Five Award Rulers**

For **each award**:
