## Positioning This Framework Within Existing Literature and Methodologies

### Why Existing “Institutional Innovation” Literature Is Insufficient
Despite decades of reform efforts, the literature on institutional innovation remains largely confined within the paradigms of policy modernization, e-government, and technocratic efficiency. Much of this work presumes that institutions can be incrementally improved through better data, digital interfaces, or performance incentives. However, in practice—especially in emerging economies—these reforms often fail to address the structural drivers of institutional failure, such as corruption inertia, opacity in bureaucratic workflows, and the asymmetry of trust across layers of governance. What is notably absent is a category of work that treats digital affordances not as tools for reform, but as substrates for reconstituting trust, value, and process at a foundational level.

### Problem Statement — Why Reform Cannot Resolve the Core Fracture
In many emerging economies, institutional collapse is not a matter of inefficiency but of design exhaustion. Reforms that aim to digitize existing processes often inherit and amplify the very pathologies they intend to solve—producing what some scholars call "digital replicas of broken bureaucracies." These efforts fail because they do not confront the deeper fracture: that trust, authority, and coordination are still anchored to legacy institutional logic, which was never designed for transparent, programmable, or tamper-evident systems. As a result, even technologically sophisticated reforms tend to plateau in environments where legitimacy, verification, and value exchange remain trapped in opaque, manual, or permissioned workflows.

### Methodological Rationale — Why Design Science + Case Study
To address this foundational misalignment, this research adopts a **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology, which prioritizes artifact creation and evaluation in real-world settings. Unlike traditional empirical approaches that seek to explain existing institutional patterns, DSR allows us to prototype and assess entirely new configurations of trust, authority, and coordination. In parallel, a **field-based case study** method grounds the inquiry in lived institutional environments, allowing us to test not only technical feasibility but governance viability. This dual methodology is essential: the design of Digital Native Institutions (DNIs) cannot be validated in theory alone—it must be deployed, iterated, and observed within the friction of real political, economic, and bureaucratic ecosystems.

### Framing the Contribution — DNIs as a New Institutional Category
This study positions **Digital Native Institutions (DNIs)** not as reformist extensions of legacy governance, but as a **new institutional category** born from first principles of digital coordination. Unlike traditional institutions, DNIs are constituted directly through executable trust, digital identity, and programmable value—enabling transparent, tamper-evident workflows without reliance on analog intermediaries. Their architecture encodes institutional logic into verifiable process flows, shifting trust from authority-based enforcement to visibility-based consensus. As such, DNIs represent a re-foundation of institutional form: not improving what exists, but enabling what was previously infeasible in high-friction, low-trust environments.

### Epistemic Placement — Situating the Framework Within and Beyond Academic Discourse
This conceptual framework therefore exists at the intersection—but also the outer edge—of institutional theory, digital governance, and socio-technical systems design. It resonates with traditions such as Elinor Ostrom’s polycentric governance, Herbert Simon’s design rationality, and the emergent field of civic technology. Yet it departs from all of them in one critical way: it does not treat the institution as a black box to be optimized, but as an **explicitly programmable substrate**. DNIs are not theorized from existing exemplars; they are synthesized from deployment—what emerges when trust, value, and process are encoded into the system itself. In this sense, the framework is not a model of something—it is a scaffold for **constituting the thing itself**.
