# Archive — Deprecated Files (Non-Canonical)

This folder contains **historical materials** from earlier phases of the
Digital Native Institutions (DNI) project.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These documents:
- were created **before** the frozen canonical theory files,  
- do **not** align with the status-function ontology,  
- predate the formal definitions of **DNI**, **NSU**, **CME**,  
- may contain conceptual drift or outdated terminology.

They are kept **only** for:
- historical traceability,
- academic transparency,
- research evolution study.

## Important

**Do not cite or use these archived files** in:
- dissertation chapters,
- theory development,
- NSU/DNI design,
- any protocol proposals.

All canonical theory lives in:

```

/theory/

```

All dissertation writing must follow:

```

/dissertation/dissertation_frame.md

```

## Purpose of Archive

This archive preserves the **evolutionary lineage** of the project  
without contaminating the active conceptual substrate.

These files are not to be edited, expanded, or merged.
